"**Crash Bandicoot N'Sane Trilogy**

I managed to hit 100% achievements on the first game last week, now making progress on #2. I spent a solid 3 hours trying to complete Stormy Ascent without dying for the time trial. God this level is frustrating. The combination of perfect jumps and timing, along with the ""slippery"" feel of ledges compared to the original games just lead to an incredibly frustrating level. Not to mention that there's a particular jump right before the finish which is one of the hardest in the game! Super frustrating to get that far then stuff it up with the finish line basically in view. Finally did it in just over 5min before finding out I needed to complete it 40sec faster for the gold relic... 

Later that day I found out that there was an actual achievement for beating that specific level with a gold time, so the next morning before work I played for another couple of hours while the level was still fresh in my head and managed to beat the level in 3:30! Pretty proud of that and probably one of my hardest gaming achievements of recent memory. And I was only 2 hours late to work! lol. 


**Halo CE** 

I've been listening to the Halo audiobooks recently so thought it was time for a replay of the series after I finished Infinite. CE is definitely starting to show its age now, but it's still a blast to play. I love that you can swap between the OG graphics and the Anniversary Edition upgrade, really helps give you that hit of nostalgia. I've played the first few Halo games numerous times but going through it all again after listening to the audiobooks is making it feel like a fresh experience which I'm loving. 

**League of Legends**

I decided to buy a new monitor to replace my 12yo Samsung. Landed on a 27"" G7 and I'm loving it. Figured I'd reinstall LoL after a 6m hiatus while URF is back and I'm enjoying myself. I do still feel like my time would be better spent making progress on my backlog of games, but something about the fast pace of League is hard to stay away from.",11,sg5z8f,0,1643594070.0
"Just started **Mass Effect 3** and I have to do some serious headcannoning to explain why my renegade Shepard is the way he is in ME3... Cause things aren't adding up! What happened while I was gone, Shepard? What happened to you!! 

I did import my save, but Shep still just feels so wrong, idk. Eh, i hope things will get better. We'll get you back in form, Shep.

For now, I'm seriously thinking of getting ME: Andromeda. People say it sucks, but some also seem to like it. Sad to read that Andromeda has no Renegade options in dialogue, but I hear that combat is really fun...",11,sg5z8f,0,1643654749.0
"I finished **Inscryption** yesterday and man that was a hell of a trip. I loved it at first for it's eerie escape room meets card game experience but as the game went on the way the story evolved became really enthralling as well. The part that struck me the most was how, despite it all, at the end I felt something genuine for the >!remaining scrybes. Leshy in particular - his last moments of only wanting to find comfort in playing cards as his world crumbled around him. The deletion of the scale and him humbly requesting just a few more rounds anyway. There was real sorrow there.!< Then the final story reveals before the game ends were pretty wild. I think I managed to find a few secrets along the way but I also know of a few I missed/skipped as well. Looking forward to trying again, maybe taking some notes along the way, and seeing if I can't uncover some more and then try Kaycee's mod. Brilliant and incredibly memorable game.",10,sg5z8f,0,1643652028.0
"I beat God of War years ago on a PS4-Pro, so I was intending to skip it for PC, but I caved. And HOLY GOD.

I am absolutely in awe at how well this game runs along with how incredible it looks. I am maintaining 120 FPS easily due to the new DLSS and the quality of the graphics on all ultra + DLSS + sharpening is actually the best looking video game I have ever played, it's that good.

There seems to be some occasional issues with DLSS sharpening, but aside from that, absolutely floored by what's been accomplished here.

So, God of War round 2 with incredible framerate and jaw-dropping graphics, I'll take it.

Aside from that, it's obviously a great game and I've forgotten most of the story, so it's been nice to revisit.",8,sg5z8f,0,1643638317.0
"# Vampire Survivors

Given the game's price point and the amount of exposure it got, it was tough to walk past it. Four hours later I have zero regrets about giving in. 

The experience it provides is just right on many levels, and creating a character build over the course of a playthrough is absolutely on point. Going from slowly killing flimsy bats to more or less instantly slaughtering whoever dares to merely look your way is a great ride.

Overall, I'm way more fond of the game than I thought I'd be. Even if its popularity completely dissipates tomorrow morning, it'll still be a genuinely fun little game.

# Alina of the Arena

It's a deck builder with tactical movement thrown in, and I'd say the game manages to execute the concept nicely enough. Definitely something to keep an eye on if such a mix seems enjoyable, and if you are unsure, a demo version is available.",6,sg5z8f,0,1643634038.0
"I've been devouring **Mass Effect 2**. It's so fun. I love it. I've been dreaming about a story like this game has for so long. To think it took me so long to play it...

I love that ME2 is super edgy, with satisfying renegade options, while taking itself so seriously and having wonderful cinematic presentation. I've been laughing so much. I am in love with my edgy ME2 Shepard with his hoodie, scars, and terminator eyes. I might like this better than KOTOR (although HK47 is still the best).

The combat is alright, I've never played cover shooters before ME so I can't judge this gameplay. Tbh I've been playing on casual and still dying in some encounters.

The structure of ME2 is so fun. I never thought I'd be into something so mission-based, I usually want open worlds/metroidvanias. But it's cool, ME2 does let you choose where to get and lets you return to old locations, so it does have that sense of a larger world.",16,sg5z8f,0,1643548888.0
"Decided to give **Psychonauts** another change. The sequel generated a lot of buzz and praise so I though I'd check out the first one and it's quite fun actually, and really funny which isn't that weird considering Tim Schafer is in it. It has some very cool concepts and a charming look to it. It's cool!",5,sg5z8f,0,1643554904.0
"**Frost Punk**

Just beat the first scenario and so far I am loving it.  It is very satisfying to build up your generator/city and go from scrapping by to being in a decent place.  The atmosphere is great and it definitely feels suitably oppressive.  The laws let you guide society a bit but some of them seem like dead ends.  ""Sustain Life"" just ended up crowding me medical facilities early on so that run tanked because my sickies accumulated.  Hope and discontent aren't too hard to balance especially with the propaganda center and guard towers.  So far I am having fun with it and am on to the ""Arks"" scenario.",6,sg5z8f,0,1643570508.0
"Continuing my Armored Core series journey, finally got 5 (out of 6) possible route/ending in **Armored Core Last Raven.**

It is by far the hardest Armored Core titles I have played so far (the newcomer chart in the game subreddit are not joking classifying it as FKING HARD). The difficulty spike is insane coming from Armored Core Nexus. 

Not only enemy's Armored Core have bonker A.I (and their stats are not dumbed down for story mission purpose), some missions even pit you against two of them back to back without any break (fk you Obi Wan Kenobi and Rim Fire).

On a side note, this is also my favorite Armored Core title so far. Love the whole 24-hour war premise, multiple path/ending structure and the Raven List feature. And fight against other Raven, while difficult, truly feels like a duel (and winning against two of them in a single mission makes you feel like a god). Also had the best story in the series because there is now actual characters involved in the story.",5,sg5z8f,0,1643600126.0
"**Returnal** At the request of a friend, I dove back to find the second ending (or third?), which is kinda hidden. Or just downright hidden, it's just that considering the general difficulty of the game it's pretty easy to find what's required for this ending, except in the sixth biome which is hard to navigate and visibility is less than great. 

I didn't really learnt anything from the second ending, but I'm not sure if I was meant to learn anything new. It was just freaky. I did enjoy my time with the game, once again, it's so fun to control and challenging, but  I'm not sure I'll be coming back unless there is new content added, which seems unlikely. An expansion would be *so* good.

**Descenders** I played this because it was a Microsoft Rewards quest, and it's definitely a chill, fun game to kill time, though I'm not in the very least interested in the subject, so I didn't really got caught on it.",6,sg5z8f,0,1643616483.0
"*ULTRAKILL*

Imagine the modern Dooms but its 10x faster, its many times less hand holdy and rigid, and it has some of the most crackhead tech you could possibly squeeze out of a game like this.

You can *PUNCH* your shotgun pellets as they fly out of your shotgun so that they fly faster and do more damage. That is the fucking essence of this game right there.

"Greetings,

I am out of games to play untill Elden Ring comes out, so I've been looking for new games to try. I was wondering that if there are any advices according to the following topics.

* I love **Blood Magic** and **Necromancy** in games and currently searching games that has these elements. Mechanics like using HP instead of mana, **Blood themed skills/spells** and so on.. I've played Guild Wars 2, liked the Necro actually. Also Path of Exile had some cool skills too like ""exsanguinate"" or ""reap"".  Also ESO has that perfectly done too, magicka Nightblade combined with Vampirism... Oh boy, that was the most fun I've had for a while back then.
* Played WoW for a decent amount of time, I would like to play it now too as a Blood Death Knight. That would really solve the problem i guess. Alas, game time's price is currently quite expensive for me in my country.
* I would prefer multiplayer games but if you have suggestions which are single player games, I will be glad to hear them too.
* Character progress is one of the crucial things for me. Leveling and developing skills, etc.
* I really like difficulty and the challenging mechanics. 

Thanks a lot in advance for your time and answers!",6,sg5z8f,0,1643931495.0
"**The Legend of Heroes: Trials of Cold Steel** 

Finally starting this after getting all four and yeah, I dig it. It's got your standard anime tropes that I don't really care for personally but the combat is pretty fun once you get into the zone of just fighting monsters that have decent designs (just like the Ys bosses, these are pretty good boss designs too) and the characters are fun for the most part, even if some are way more interesting then others. 

I will say the abundance of cutscenes together can be annoying since it leads to be very drawn out but for pacing, it's not terrible. The social stuff is pretty fun and while they aren't in-depth conversations, it works for the overall system it's trying to make. I'm excited for the field study stuff since you finally get to move out of just Gaius and Elliot and I bet I'm not even 10% through the game.

**Uncharted 2 - Among Thieves** 

Not this is awesome. The first one is fun but I never had this big tense moment of action that while the first was decent at, this one I fucking love. I haven't even gotten to the shooting sections and it's already getting me excited (I'm chapter 3) and the new characters are pretty fun even if the writing still isn't 100% there yet.",11,sg5z8f,0,1643567711.0
"Still been playing **Halo Infinite** pretty regularly since it released. Which is kinda big for me, I rarely stick with multiplayer games for long. I even finished out all of the generated weekly challenges without even noticing... I was just playing the games cause I was having fun. 

I've dipped into the campaign a bit, and while it's definitely well produced and the gameplay is very solid, I think I would have preferred a more focused linear campaign similar to prior Halo titles. Luckily when you get into many of the main missions, you do get this feeling back. 

I also replayed **Hitman** 1 and 2 from the trilogy on gamepass. No new thoughts as I'd played these before on PS4, I just wanted to catch up my account's PC progress before starting the third game. Which, I haven't played any of yet besides the intro to the first mission, but I'm very excited to! I consider the first two games to be some of the best stealth games ever made. 

For my RPG fix I've kinda been bouncing between a few old reliables. Mass Effect, Morrowind, Oblivion. I bought Neverwinter Nights on sale as well - seems like it could be a promising one. Really I'm just trying to kill time until Baldur's Gate 3 gets a full release. I don't want to burn out on the early access, but what I did play I *absolutely adored*.",4,sg5z8f,0,1643631386.0
"Finished **Gears of War: Ultimate Edition** with my wife. Game is a little rougher and loose with controls than what I remembered, and is missing a good amount of the staples that became great in the later releases. Gears 2 & 3 are by far still the best but I appreciated what they managed to make with this game.

**Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition -** A little over halfway through the game. The story is great, the combat is great, the side quests are boring but they throw them in the path of your main story anyway so it doesn't bother me too much. I do feel like I am always overleveled because I have been doing like 80% of the side quests but that's not a huge issue.

**Illusion of Gaia** \- This game had a huge difficulty spike with the first boss. I was playing it loose and careless before but now I see the way this needs to be played. I am loving it.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643634220.0
"I've played through both **Little Nightmares** and **Little Nightmares 2** within two or three days after not really playing any games for quite a while. I loved the games even though I usually don't give a damn about any platformer style games. ~~Which includes your 2D fave. Yes, even *that* one.~~

I like horror games but often am too scared to finish games such as the first Amnesia - but LN was just challenging and playable enough for me to make it through without being bored. I even bought the DLC, something I rarely care for these days. 

The Spirited Away influence was very obvious but also effective in certain later levels, some of the most memorable ones from the game for me. >!Other than the obvious moments of Six going nuts.!< The games as a whole were much darker than I expected from the rather adorable character models. 

>!Loved the fact that there seemingly are no happy endings, although I'm not completely sure if that's what I hope for the future of the franchise.!< It might get old otherwise. 

Glad that the sequel improved the gameplay that annoyed me the most in the first, namely that we now couldn't just walk off surfaces all the time, the main cause of death in the first game for me.

Otherwise I've been trying again to get into **Disco Elysium**. I absolutely love some of the dialogue options (and I'm definitely a superstar) but I'm so horribly overwhelmed by the information and details in the game that I've always stopped at some point. I don't even have any better explanation other than this.",4,sg5z8f,0,1643742226.0

"**Monster Hunter Rise**

This was purchased for PC at full price.

I'd say at this point with 160+ hours in I've experienced most of what Rise has to offer now. Only thing I haven't done is most of the Arena Quests (I've stuck to one weapon, and that's a no go for the time trials) I'm missing one Apex monster and a few what I'd call Capstone quests that involve being put in the arena with two monsters that are out for your throat.

Most of what I said prior still applies: I like the game and had plenty of fun, but the Palamutes and iffy climbing physics still bug me more than I feel they should. However my thoughts on some monsters being ""Way too fast"" have drastically changed as I've improved, though how much of this is actually me being better and just getting Evade Extend and Evade Window in my armor I'm not sure.

I want to focus on my late game issues: The Apex Monsters, The Necklace system, and the lack of an impactful feeling post-game final boss.

First: Hunting the Apexes outside of Rampages is genuinely a blast. They certainly feel and act like deviants (In fact I'm pretty sure Apex >!Zinogre!< is just >!Thunderlord Zinogre!< in all but name. He's even the same shade of green and gold). They are dangerous, have new moves, and usually have some form of badass desperation move you have to respect or just get annihilated. 

But the problem is that the effort needed doesn't feel worth while. Only 1 part is unique from their vanilla counterparts, and with the exception of two of them they're only used for Rampage weapons. Not armor. So outside of completion for clearing Events and High Rank quests you can just ignore them and fight them in Rampages to farm the parts with random people easier.

The Necklaces being RNG to acquire instead of Decorations in theory I think is supposed to feel better but for me it doesn't. I don't blame anyone who spent actual days or weeks farming for a fabled Attack Jewel and hating it, but dumping pounds and pounds of parts to try and roll for a necklace with 3 sockets and a perfect skill roll feels kind of worse to me.

My issue is two fold: I know I don't need these excess parts, but it feels bad doing it when I *might* one day need them to make Decorations. It's not logical, but to optimally roll for Necklaces it takes a huge amount of parts to completely fill a batch.

My second problem is you end up getting flooded with tons of Necklaces, many of them aren't optimal or good. And while you can throw in the unwanted necklaces to try and re-roll for better ones, it still results in a lot of annoying inventory bloat because while the necklace icons are color-coded, they aren't coded by the Skills or Gem Slots, just by the rarity assigned to them.

I got lucky and got a necklace with 3 decoration slots, level 3 Counter Strike and Level 1 Evade Window. It's not perfect, but it's good enough that I just never want to bother with the system again even if that necklace isn't great for some weapons.

My final issue is clearly caused by covid, and looking into it Switch players have known about this for awhile due to Rise's content schedule seeming to be behind. PC players get access to everything upfront but I can still kind of feel it being lacking compared to World. It feels like there is no great hurdle to aspire to go after with the lack of Arch Tempered monsters or effective Superbosses like World's Leshen or Behemoth.

The closest to these would be >!The Allmother!< Who honestly feels more like the Xeno'Jiva equivalent and >!Crimsonglow Valstrax!< Who cool as he is, just feels like he's on par with any other Elder Dragon like say Kirin or Teostra. The lack of a closing capstone has made the closing of my time with the game until Sunbreak feel empty.

I still have greatly enjoyed my time with Rise, I put in 160 hours since launch a few weeks ago I can't say I didn't enjoy it at that rate. But these were the issues that bugged me most.",7,sg5z8f,0,1643539112.0
"Tomb Raider 2013: I went back to the reboot trilogy for a fresh playthrough with the intention of taking my time to enjoy the environments and atmosphere. I ended up 100 percenting 2013 and moving straight onto Rise. There's a technical and design leap that I hadn't noticed when playing these games at release. Subtle things like the map, UI, default controls, pacing and in more noticeable elements such as the mechanics and sound design all come across as a team truly learning and evolving. There's even some streamlining of mechanics too, such as removing the need to toggle the silencer on your pistol. Once you have the upgrade it's always on. Overall, I am eating the experience much better than I did the first run through.",7,sg5z8f,0,1643834005.0
"I'm playing **FFXIV**.


It's been great for the past year or so since going back in during the last patch cycle of ShB. Tons of content. Now, after a new release of expansion, I'm caught up with current content and just doing re-clears and/or PUG prog. 

It's getting dry is what I'm feeling, but anyone who plays MMOs will know what I'm talking about. I'm at a point where I'm pretty much done with the game, but the MMO hamster wheel has me wanting to daily/weeklies. 

Don't get me wrong, I still love the game, and I love the gameplay, but I don't like that a some of me is hamster wheel driven. I'm fully aware of it and I'm teetering on knowing I'm having fun and knowing I'm also pretty much done until next big patch. So I'm trying to pull myself away, but then I'll find myself having fun or wanting to do something else in game.

Still being gripped by the shadowbringer story high and then content catch up then going through up and downs(mostly downs) of PUG raiding.

"Finished my NG+ run of **Transistor** and 100% achievements! Despite my initial frustration, I'm glad I pushed through and ultimately feel like I had a very enjoyable time with the game. Definitely 4/5 for me.

I was on the right track but still wrong about what was a *really* good NG+ build last week. Once I got the required duplicate functions I tried the [Super Lifesteal Void](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365467743) build and was immediately impressed. It was key for the 10 limiter achievement for me! After making it through the Performance Test 7, though, I think my personal favorite is Tap(Breach, Get) & Void(Crash, Spark) with Jaunt as passive. Using Purge & Tap on Void for the life steal *is* bonkers but the ""mash void outside of turn"" gameplay is just uninteresting & also takes a stupidly long time to kill things. I feel like a ninja when I Turn() and one-hit KO everything near me, and if I only do one Void+Tap while in Turn, the meter regenerates faster than I can get in position for my next killing move. (final boss spoilers) >!In the end, I blasted Royce's last 3 lives without him using Turn on me in that time-span, which felt amazing.!<

Also started **Ico** on the PS3. Quit about an hour and 45 min in because my hand was feeling a bit sore and I think I'd hit my limit on cavernous tiled backgrounds for one day. I think playing an hour a day over the week will be a good way to tackle it! I suspect it has less impact on me because I'm already familiar with the mechanics that made their way into modern games (eg. jumping up to and hanging from ledges) but I'm interested to see how it develops as I get further in.

I think I'll be starting Death's Door on Tuesdays & Thursdays while my partner is away in the evenings, since that's a game we both want to play without being spoiled, and potentially wrapping up my playthrough of Eastshade during the rest of the week so I can finally cross it off my list.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643561988.0

"**National Lampoon's Blind Date**

I heard about this game when I saw a commercial for it in an old tape I was watching the other day and it looked pretty interesting. So I went over to Old Games.com and downloaded it(thankfully the download comes with Dosbox already configured so i didn't have to screw around with that)and it's one of those FMV games, this one is a dating sim that's very much a 90s time-capsule with lots of pop-culture references, it's pretty funny at times. There's a lot of trial and error with finding out which answers are the right ones(and some of them are so ridiculous it's sometimes hard to tell)there's a mood ring system where if you piss off your date(Sandi) too much you fail, you have to make sure to have enough cash for certain parts. Thankfully you can save the game and if you make it to the second-half(Sandi inviting you to her house)you can just choose to start from there if you fail afterwards. Unfortunately so far i've been unable to actually get with Sandi so far despite seemingly doing everything right and getting all the questions in her test right(some of which are pretty vague and which I was only able to get right from watching a longplay, but even the person doing the longplay seemingly couldn't figure out how to get with Sandi at the end)i've only ever been able to get the ending where you get to pick between her two roommates(they don't get nude or anything, so don't get too excited)i'm really clueless as to how to get the best ending(and I know one exists because the commercial I saw for this game showed a scene with Sandi and her two roommates and she asks if you want her or all three of them)and i've really been banging my head against the wall here trying to figure out how to do it, i'm really surprised that there isn't one single guide for this game anywhere online. Maybe i'll have to resort to buying old PC mags from 1994 online and see if any of them have a guide on this game(did PC games get strategy guides printed in magazines back then like Nintendo and Sega did? I wasn't really into PC gaming much then so I dunno).

Anyone on here ever played that game? If so were you actually able to get the best ending or are you as stumped as I am?",3,sg5z8f,0,1643574011.0
"**Battletech**

As the days to Elden Ring close near, I've decided to go with Battletech which should fill most of the month. It feels nice to play a SRPG again after what feels like a long time. Battletech is one of those games where you're off to a better start reading half a dozen guides and planning your builds. 

I started on campaign with the default settings for my first try. I ended up stuck in the first area for too long doing crappy missions trying to put together enough parts to replace the crappy Spider with a medium mech but after the missions got too easy, just settled with a mech with some real armour. The story mission ended up being pretty easy.

The game really opens up after that. I've been really enjoying some of what feels like overpowered mech builds I've put together, like close range SRM stacked melee mechs, LRM boats and my new recent and exciting addition and my first heavy mech, the gauss rifle loaded Marauder. This thing is single shot call striking mechs from the front and it's spectacular. Can't wait to pick up some more gauss or an assault mech to really cause devastation.

The major flaw I've found so far is how easy it is to piss off the pirates who run the black market. Campaign restricts the difficulty of missions as the story progresses so  eventually makes it impossible to boost reputation with pissed off factions, and these guys run the black market which sell the best stuff and their level of being pissed off dictates the mark up. Luckily I managed to get in early and with a lot of reloading have been able to start upping their reputation but it seems like a massive flaw with the campaign design.

I've barely started and have a long way to go and career mode to also check out before the month end draws near.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643579423.0
"**Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition**

About 4 hours in and I can definitely see the Stalker comparisons with this version of Metro. This is the first time in Metro universe where you are given some freedom in an semi open world space. It isn't as nearly as big as Stalker is, but it gives off some similar vibes.

The gun play is excellent and Metro Exodus streamlines certain aspects of a survival horror. For example, you don't have to worry about hunger or sleep. You don't have to run around collecting and managing dozens of different items. Yet it incorporates enough elements that it makes the game completely immersive. There is no health bar; guns can jam at crucial times (a clean gun is super important) and ammo is fairly scarce. I think Metro Exodus struck the perfect balance here.

However, its not perfect. In the first open world part of the game, its easy, almost comically easy to avoid combat in the open field. The story is semi-incoherent thus far. The AI can be brain dead at times and the game is quite buggy. On more than 1 occasion, I've ran into regular zombies who were completely invincible. I unloaded about 3 clips of ammo on them before realizing that was a bug, not a feature.

But overall, I'm very impressed with how the Metro series has evolved from the first game. Without knowing how this one ends,  I hope we get more in the future.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643693879.0

"**Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age** (Switch)

This is very different from the other FF titles I've played (VI, VII, VIIR, IX, X, and XV). The stakes so far seem very low and the gambit system makes the moment to moment gameplay a little weird. I'm still liking it and I'm intrigued by the policical aspect of the story, but I worry that the gambit system is going to turn the game into a series of cutscenes spaced apart by the game playing itself.

**Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel** (PC)

This is the best Yugioh simulator out there. The animations add a ton, the crafting system is amazing, and the OST is way better than it has any right to be. That said, the gem economy is scare if you don't want to spend money on it and figuring out what deck to play for new or returning players required a ton of investment that might not pay off. I'm missing a couple staples, but I've built and Phantom Knight and Virtual World deck completely free to play and have been having a ton of fun throwing them against the ranked ladder.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643929786.0

"**Horizon Zero Dawn (PS5)**

I played this game for about 3-4 hours when it originally came out before putting it down. But I figured I'd pick it up again because the sequel is coming out. I'm probably not picking up the sequel at launch because there are so many super hype games coming out in the next 4-6 weeks. Here are my thoughts! For reference, I'm playing on Hard mode and I'm about 10 or so hours in (I just got to the Carja border).

* The combat against robots is super fun. Setting up traps, blasting off parts, using different elemental arrows, etc. It's all super satisfying.
* The combat against humans is pretty disappointing. Especially when compared to the robot combat.
* The map design and traversal is... alright. The game is only 5 years old, but it feels a little outdated now that most games seem to be using Breath of the Wild's ""you can climb anything"" approach. Also there are so many bonfires/save points that it's a little silly. Some of them have literally been like 10 seconds away from each other.
* The world itself is super interesting. The mix of hunter/gatherer society + robots is awesome.
* The FoV is *atrocious.* 60-70 FoV is *way too low.* It actively hurts my enjoyment of the game, and it makes some combat encounters more difficult than they should be. I really hope the sequel is more generous in this regard. But considering the game is still going to be on PS4, I'm a little worried.
* The story/characters are surprisingly bland. I say ""surprisingly"" because I've read a *ton* of praise for this game's story. But so far the main story has been paint by numbers, and none of the characters are interesting. Aloy herself is dull as dishwater. It's especially disappointing that >!Bast and Vala die 10 minutes after you meet them, and they seemed like they had the most potential. They also killed off Rast at the start, which was pretty expected, but he also could've had some interesting development.!<",12,sg5z8f,0,1643557710.0
"**Pokemon Legends Arceus**

I'm enjoying myself, but strangely I don't have anything nice to say about the game.  Nothing super bad either, but no praise to sing.  None of the pieces really....fit together.  It's alot of good ideas with the bare minimum of implementation.

Pokedex having a bunch of additional tasks is a good idea, which could encourage you to do more than simply catch a pokemon and never look at it again.  But, in implementation I just find myself catching 25 Bidoofs...and it feels like for no real reason.  I catch them, so I can get paid, and ultimately release them I guess?  As I type it out it feels like the very definition of busywork. It would be one thing if it felt like Galaxy team was putting those numbers to use...but no as far as I can tell you just release them.  This is one of many examples where it felt like they were on the cusp of a really good idea, but it didn't get there.

Despite the fact that the game basically wants you to catch dozens of each pokemon, the box system is unchanged from previous entries.  After only a dozen hours it has become an ungodly mess with no sign it will get better.  I can't even sort the box as far as I can tell.

The gameplay itself is fine.  I'm enjoying running around, trying to sneakily catch pokemon, and sometimes battle them instead.  But other games have done this better.  The non-turnbased piece is like if you tried to replicate Horizon Zero Dawn for a weekend game jam.  Sneak in the grass, launch a projectile at a weak point (every pokemon has the same weak point though, their back), dodge roll if they attack you. At nearly every turn, this game has the problem that other games have done what it does, only better.

The game falls into the same leveling trap many others open exploration games get stuck in, through no fault of its own really.  This is the pokemon game where you explore, and as such, I explored.  I've just been running around catching and battling, and by the time I went back to the story my party was 20-30 levels over the next main quest opponent, and that includes rotating my roster to fill out more pokedex challenges. It's basically the same problem as Xenoblade Chronicles.  If you do all the sidequests they give you, it's mathematically impossible to not get overleveled (although XC added a hard mode to address this). Pokemon has always had this problem, but it feels worse now because they give you so much more to do (and they literally want you to catch 25/defeat 25 of every pokemon, and they give your whole party XP for each one).

Dodging is a cool idea, but doesn't feel like it belongs.  Since it isn't actually used during real combat, it's rarely needed, and when it is needed the attacks feel very awkward.  It still feels like a turn based attack and you just have to time your generously large iframe window.  It's barely a step above a QTE basically. Maybe if pokemon moved during battle, and you had to be aware of your surroundings.  Something, anything.  Once again, it just feels like another concept that didn't get fleshed out.

The game's biggest, most unforgivable flaw, is that one of the Player Character outfits is a suit with a bowtie, and you cannot customize the color of the bowtie to match Rowlet's.  I cannot describe in the English language how disappointing that is to me.

This is the revolutionary pokemon game the series needed....15 years ago.  I'm glad we finally got here, but this game wouldn't be worth talking about at all if it wasn't a pokemon game.  It's fine, I'm having enough fun, but there are better games out there.

All that said, I absolutely plan to keep exploring, catching, and battling.  Despite the criticism above, I am enjoying myself but I don't really have any praise for the game. It isn't as good as any of the other games that feel similar.  If it wasn't Nintendo, I'd say wait for a sale, but since Nintendo won't put it on sale... I'll just say you'll get the experience you expect from trailers.",17,sg5z8f,0,1643561100.0
"**Pokemon Arceus**

I gotta say, this is the first Pokemon game since Silver/Gold/Yellow that has really really hooked me.

The game is not perfect, has a ton of things I wish was done better and some minor QoL gripes like for example, you use the (-) button to open the map, but pressing it again changes the map zoom level, it does not close it. Just a few issue with how controls are and harder to remember.

As a game is does feel like that BOTW moment for Pokemon, but it misses a few marks so it doesn't quite get up there, but it is a great game that if improved could be the best for mainline Pokemon. 

The gameplay itself does feels just a little bit like Monster Hunter, but not really. You just have to go out on an ""expedition"" which amounts to a load screen. You can still just go around and do any mission as you please, it is not locked to just one objective.

The way to fill up the Pokedex is so satisfying and just checks that box for me. 

I am about 10hrs in so don't know how long I have left, but I am hooked and enjoying this a lot. I really hope this is the way going forward for the mainline series. If not at least keep making this Legends series for each gen?",7,sg5z8f,0,1643640225.0
"Reached credits on **Hades**, fuck this game is fantastic. Between the god powers, the keepsakes and companions, the different weapons and weapon aspects, the Pact of Punishment challenges, it really helps to keep every run feeling pretty fresh. And somehow managing to weave a coherent story into a roguelite is honestly beyond impressive. There are still more quests and such for me to do so I'm definitely gonna keep playing, but probably not quite as obsessively as I have for the past few weeks.",7,sg5z8f,0,1643868205.0
"I've been playing **Assassin's Creed: Valhalla**. Spent over fifty hours in it, but decided to call it quits and never pick up another AC or Ubisoft open world game again. I have nothing against their vision or narrative perspective, I have, however, nothing but contempt at the state that the game is in even after it's been more than a year of release. I could have probably looked past some graphics bugs, but I could not look past my character when attempting to jump getting stuck in the air (usually when you are trying to get in between gaps in fences, but also can happen during combat for some reason) and getting desynchronized, god awful NPC AI script wherein the NPC side quest giver or whatever per script is going to follow only the path you are taking (in this case, I acquired an ability for my horse to swim, so instead of the NPC going a bit further down the road like in the previous games, the NPC goes after me in to the water, but he cannot swim and he's stuck there indefinitely), some world events being bugged, the fact that you have to put items/characters down at precise point, a millimetre to the left or right will not register at all... but the most furious thing in this game was constant crashes. The game crashed almost once per day for me. I had a week where I though, well, thank god, the devs may have done something, but, nope, it was only a fluke, and the game crashed two times in two days. That's when I said enough is enough with it.

Yesterday, I started playing **The Last of Us Part II**. And despite knowing that Abbie does what she does, that first hour and the half of the game (yes, even with 20 or so minutes of cinematics) was miles more enjoyable for me than 50 hours spent with AC: Valhalla.",7,sg5z8f,0,1643736285.0

"**Trails in the Sky FC**

I have played through all of Cold Steel and I originally didn't have much interest in getting into Trails in the Sky largely due to the lack of voice acting. I dunno, maybe it's a petty reason but I find the lack of voice acting in a game where the personalities of the characters is one of the big highlights to be too much of a deficiency. Voice acting does so much heavylifting in bringing out the personalities of each character that I just find it almost mandatory in a game like this. I only recently found out that it's actually possible to mod voice acting into this game so that's why I got into it. The mod works like a charm. Skipping lines works perfectly, I've had no issues, it just works.

I generally know all the broad strokes of the story (and a bit more) because I watched long ass story recaps of these games before I played Cold Steel 3 to understand all the references and shit. But it's kinda the little things that make these stories so enjoyable and it's the little things that I lack familiarity with so I can still enjoy story almost like I'm experiencing it the first time. Except now I can get all excited about meeting characters like Olivier for the first time because I already know who they are.

I'm not that far into the game, I'm only at chapter 2 but I'm enjoying it so far. I've never been a fan of the super deformed character aesthetic but I think I can live with it.",5,sg5z8f,0,1643557979.0

Finished up the Career Mode on this yesterday. 

Probably my third favorite racing game of all time behind Mario Kart 8 & 7. Im not much of a racing game person & full on racing sims just don’t do it for me. But this was weird enough that it made me love it. Gorgeous graphics, fun gameplay, great course aesthetics, awesome soundtrack. My new number 8 for Game of the Year 2020.

I hated the deep sand races, the podcasts didn’t interest me in the slightest, had a couple *slightly* annoying songs, I didn’t care about the Gymkhana levels & the last 3 races were awful. 

**Persona 5 Strikers** 

A little over 8 hours in.

Loving how much of this is an actual sequel to P5. I really didn’t expect this level of staying true to the game it is following. Feels unique, especially in combat, without feeling foreign.

"Still plodding through **Two Point Hospital**.  I had over 100 hours on this game prior to restarting it, and I'll probably be well over 300 by the time I finish it again.  Each hospital takes \~5 hours and there are something like 35 with all the DLC.  I enjoy the cozy atmosphere though, especially the winter levels for this season.  I enjoy putting wood burning stoves and hot chocolate tables in each room.  

Along with replaying a hospital management sim I figured I might as well replay a dwarf management sim, and have started up **Craft the World** again.  This game lacks polish in areas and definitely seems like a cash grab in others, but overall I enjoy it.  Making a cozy little house for your dwarves to venture out of and mine precious ore to become the greatest warriors in the land.  I purchased the Heroes DLC, which I'm enjoying.

"Finished :**Children of Morta**

Overall it was a great game. Interesting lore and story, with intriguing characters as well. Great pixel art too, though pixel scaling when zooming in and out looks very offputing and weird.

For the gameplay, it was okay. Every characters was viable to use with distinct playstyle, which is great, though the roguelike element could be better, as i found most of the relic/graces/runes are kind of basic, which is fine, but i didnt feel much of an interesting synergy in most of my build.  I find myself just winging it most of the time to get to the bosses. Thats just me though.

It ran well, except for a few bugs i come across. One run playing as Mark, i encountered a bug where he cant hit at all with normal attack, changing room wont reset, so had to die. Which brings one of my biggest problem with the game, the hit register for close combat characters. Even in normal run with no bugs, sometimes Mark's punch wont connect to a marked enemies at all. Mark was one of my favorite characters, but had to ditch him when i realized how iffy the hit register on his attack. I avoid using Kevin as well in the end.

Finished:**Red Dead Redemption**

Managed to finished it on Xenia. Overall, enjoyable, but i prefer RDR2 by a mile. My main complaint is a bit similiar to GTA V, theres just too many one dimensional joke characters, like Dickens, Seth, Irish, De Santa, Allende, Reyes, Professor Harold, etc. I didn't found them amusing at all, more annoying to be honest. I liked the more serious character like Bonnie, Ricket, Luisa, and Nastas, >!but those last two was killed for the stupidest reasons before develpoing more characteristics, Jesus!<. One of my favorite characters in RDR2 was Charles Smith, >!imagine if he was killed off for shock value to save one of the jokes characters, like say Sean!<. Since RDR2 was newer, i guess i have high hopes for whatever comes next from R\*, hoping that these awful jokes characters are just an old gen (PS3/Xbox360) era fascinations of such characters. I remember someone mentioning that GTA IV Mori/Brucie Kibbutz was one of the fan favorites characters, which is why i guess R\* leaned a bit too heavy with such characters in its sequels, and maybe it affect RDR1 that way as well, idk, but my god, do i found Kibbutz type characters uninteresting and annoying.

The more i played RDR1, the more i appreciate its prequels, because it added more depth to some characters in RDR1 that i found lacking, mainly for Bill, Escuella, and Dutch. Like, if i didnt play RDR2, i would write them off quickly as the backstory shown in RDR1 are just vague and generic.>! I didnt expect Dutch to ends up killing him self by gravity, made me remember that one moment with Arthur in RDR2 he jumped to escape the Pinkertons. He said i have a plan for one last time too, kinda heartbreaking to be honest, as he finally realized he cant fight change.!<

Currently Playing :**Ring of Pain**, and **One Step From Eden**

My next roguelikes after Children of Morta. Playing these game for a while, i guess im more of an action roguelike kinda guy, as i can't figure this card game stuff out lol.

For **Ring of Pain**, i kinda get the gimmick, but after a few dungeons/paths later, i find the enemies at certain level spiked too high in difficulty. Like one dungeons before, i manages to kill enemies easily, but at the next path suddenly theres an enemies with 10 shield, 10 attacks and such, while my stats still on a single digits, thats already including me always trying to get those stats up cards in previous dungeons. Sure you could sneak, but i guess im unlucky, and most of the time i got severely punished.

I'm still interested in the game, still trying to figure this shit out, though in the meantime, im trying **One Step From Eden** as well. Now this is kinda my jam, more action-y card game with active involvement from the players, though from early hours that i've played, its actually a bit too much for me.  So..many..mechanics. and the real time gameplay needed a lot of focus on the movement and positioning too. Im very overwhelmed right now, but its still enjoyable experience so far.

Currently Playing :**Dragon Age Origins**

Another game i had no idea how to play lol. I mean, i have some idea about such gameplay, but i guess i suck at it lol. Cant figured out how to setup those tactics, i find myself just mashing the skills button randomly after cooldown. I need to look up for beginner tutorial on this one, i guess.

Im still early into the game, at Ostagar trying to light a beacon in Tower of Ishal. Intriguing start i got to say, definitely interested to explore more, but i got to figure out how to not suck at the game first lol.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643559116.0
"**[stellaxy (demo):](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1226890/)** space exploration rpg with ms paint graphics. came out 2+ years ago, only ran into it now because it's still being updated. you have to fly around the universe, probe planets, land, gather minerals, probably do something with them, find cities, talk to people and possibly other life forms, who knows what else. it might actually be pretty cool but the ui is tiny, no rebindable controls and saving is only possible at designated spots. ui scaling is being worked on, maybe the other stuff will happen at some point too, then I might pick it up.

**[puzzle poker:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/554660/)** didn't realize the creator of **tim** (only on gog these days) also made a card game in 2006, but here it is. in true 1024x768 glory whether windowed or full screen, but hey, follow on twitter and earn fucking steam achievements because that's more important than resolution options when putting the game on steam in 2017... 4 game modes but it's really just 2 with a few options. one is a matching game where you move entire rows/columns, the other is more strategic. wait for sale.

**[twinstack:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753560/)** when in doubt, I either play solitaire or some endless/random thing for an hour or so. this is horizontal tetris with shapes coming from both sides (alternating or at the same time). build a 'base' in the middle, attach the rest to it. controls need getting used to because they're reversed for each side. I got almost the same score in both modes, but sadly visibility is poor even with nighttime and background objects turned off, and the latter has to be done every time the game is started, so not great overall.

**[lego worlds:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/332310/)** only played a few lego games, they're not for me (hate platformers) and mostly about franchises I don't care about. I did suffer through most star wars games a long time ago and **lego universe** was pretty cool for an mmo. I even paid for the first and last time for a single month to do all the content solo (didn't have anybody to play with and chat was beyond restrictive to protect kids). even got a retail copy for the memories, then it closed at the end of that year. I was planning to go back maybe once a year to see what's new.

this with big (or so I thought) worlds to explore seemed interesting enough. got it from a bundle, been waiting for dlc to get cheap, never happened, so I let go. turns out, adventure mode is just 3 small tutorial levels, then random worlds to explore. I got 3 on the map, a winter location (couldn't find any quests besides getting fish for penguins) and one for each paid dlc. didn't take them long to ask for more money, the fuckers. there's a random world finder, found a western map but gave up after.

controls are shit and non-rebindable, movement is slow as fuck, terrain editing is messy, can't even hold undo to undo more. and it's probably just on my end, but loading times are unbelievable. it took 10 minutes(!) to load each level. volume setting for sound, music just on/off, nothing for the booming voice of the fucking narrator or the annoying gibberish.

doesn't like alt+tabbing either, the omnipresent cursor can freeze and clicking anywhere just minimizes the game, then maybe changes it to 800x600 resolution. awesome job... lots of shit to skip on startup as well but can't skip everything. it also tries to connect to a server even though I only want to play alone, offline.

scanning objects to summon them later would be fun with better controls, lots of things to see and build if you're into that, plus multiplayer if you have like-minded friends, but this shouldn't be a fully released game sold for 30 eur (38 with dlc).

**[kavel:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1414530/)** lunar sale pickup, finally hit -50% (2 eur). endless score attack, I don't like to pay too much for those, get bored of them after an hour or so. though to be fair it's not much less than I pay for whatever else, with a few exceptions. they're all games I want to play, so they mostly get the same very low budget.

anyway, it's tetromino-based matching. mobile port, portrait-oriented board with backgrounds to fill the screen. many settings but only toggles for music and sound, no volumes. the tutorial is annoying with slow and noisy text display but you'll only see it once, if that. 3 game modes but it's all the same, only the basics are explained in the tutorial, the rest is in a steam guide posted by the developer. good stuff otherwise, needs a bit more polish.

**[drawkanoid:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/951370/)** I was in the mood for some block-breaking but instead of playing something unplayed I already have, grabbed this for 2 eur. runs on win7 despite the 8.1 minimum on the store page but no way in hell it'd run on 2 gb of ram, as stated. it was constantly using 2-3 gb of memory of my shitty pc's 4 and it's a fucking mobile game.

it's really fast arkanoid but the ball goes bullet time when you're supposed to hit it back with a paddle that only exists if you draw it yourself. if all the marked blocks are gone, the boss comes and hitting it once ends the level, no need to hunt down everything. sounds easy, it's not.

great soundtrack but looks very mobiley with black bars on the side. some static backgrounds would've made it look less cheap. settings are for separate volumes, resolutions, windowed mode and screen shake, would've liked to turn a few effects off too, but lowering the resolution mostly solved my performance issues.

it's pretty cool, has permanent upgrades and selectable power-ups. played until I unlocked everything, the rest would be just improving my score (21k was my best) but I don't play breakout and tetris to get good. a couple hours (or 4) of fun before moving on to something else, then next time I'll play a different one.

**[gardener's path:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1775750/)** another 2 eur purchase, -50% a month after release. emailed the dev with questions when it came out, no reply, reviews are useless, but it looked good enough to try at this price, as I like sliding games. graphics and music are certainly excellent, but that's not where most games fail, and this is very bad otherwise. shitty controls besides the four directions, there's rebinding but the keyboard is treated as a fucking 3-button controller and defaults are shown no matter what. no undo and text appearss slowly and with annoying sounds (you can press a key to make it appear instantly, but only one, why would esc, space or enter do anything). 60 levels, mostly easy, shouldn't take long but it's not recommendable.

**[mendel's garden:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132160/)** one of my favorite puzzle devs released a voxel-based farming sim (his signature style, you could say) a couple years ago. bought it on day 1 despite being in early access to play whenever it's done, but he just announced he can't be a full-time dev anymore and the game got removed from sale a few hours later. no more updates, so I started playing. (btw, his 4 puzzlers ([senna and the forest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113690/), [kili's treasure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1219020/), [timpu's treasure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186690/), [nine lives](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340310/)) are going free on feb15, all very good stuff).

only 1 of the 4 planned locations is available and as usual, it would've needed some polish (abysmal p&c movement (wasd also works, also not great), text display sound toggle, typos, not just at the end of a day, music barely playing, item discard confirmation, better fast travel, etc.) but it's fine otherwise, though some stuff is hard to figure out, had to look at the forums.

you're in a garden, need to grow stuff for your corporate overlords to make food and shit, though that's not exactly why you went there. planting two seeds in one place lets you combine their traits and the instant rain button takes care of water twice a day, then time to go underground and wait for tomorrow. that's when the game saves and since there's no time limit, stamina or any of that, technically you can save anytime without missing anything and stuff will also grow overnight. unknown flower seeds have to be planted to see what traits they have, e.g. if it's blue and red, some will be one, others the other.

I enjoyed it but the final area has some respawning obstacles that have to be taken care of by exploding them with explody plants every few turns (after every other rainfall or so), that added some unnecessary tedium already provided by finicky controls and fast travel. at one point I thought I couldn't even go back to previous areas to make the necessary plants to progress but it was just the controls. I'm sure the final product would've been pretty cool though, just like the dev's other works.

"**Not For Broadcast**

This was quite a mixed bag.

It is certainly entertaining as a bunch of fun video clips. The performances and presentation are solid, and there’s a great sense of absurdity which is often funny (especially the songs, which would make for a solid soundtrack release). The gameplay is nothing special but it keeps the player occupied.

The problem is the underlying story. For some reason the absurd clips are tied together by a dark political narrative. Even this is presented ridiculously - the government is so extreme as to be nonsense and the rebels are cartoonish - yet the game chooses to depict their actions with deadly seriousness. The tonal whiplash in going from a silly celebrity parody to seeing that celebrity executed in cold blood is incredible. The dark ending to the second chapter jarred, but I was still invested as it was so well done. When they did the same with the third chapter, I no longer cared.

**Blacksad**

The Blacksad comics debuted in 2000. But for its reasonable graphics, this game could well be a product of that era. 

The controls are sluggish, both for the character and camera. Hotpoints are finicky to interact with (exacerbated by those poor controls). There are arbitrary QTE deaths. There are empty open environments with invisible walls (though some are missed, so you can make your character wander far out of view).

It feels like a relic of long-ago games from the genre. It borrows Telltale's alerts that decisions will have an impact, but the eventual impact often didn't make much sense at least as presented.

Then there are the bugs. The responses didn't work at all in one conversation. Others cited choices I hadn't made. The visuals cut out altogether at one point, requiring a restart. A few times it got stuck at the loading screen (it took me a while to realise it was stuck, as loading times are slow).

A great story may have made up for this, but it's just okay. The source material doesn't help much in this respect. I didn't care much for the horrors of war being delivered through anime schoolgirls in Valkyria Chronicles, and having the victim of a murder be a character seemingly designed as a furry pinup also takes away some of the emotional impact. Indeed, there's a rather hamhanded effort to try to provoke emotional investment at times, perhaps to try to compensate for this. 

It's not a terrible game, but a flawed framework around a mediocre story places it well below other options in the genre.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643576462.0
"I just finished two smaller games:

**Untitled Goose Game**

It's a fun, little puzzle game. As the title implies you take control over a goose on your way spreading chaos in a small neighborhood. Most of the time that involves getting on somebody's nerves by destroying, stealing or even frigthening someone. It sounds harsh but it is presented in a rather slapstick, humorous manner. And besides, it is kinda funny to see how you do something wicked just to lock eyes with your victim and he/she has no other way to react than to shake his/her head. But as fun as it is, I don't think it was the right time for me to play it. I think you need to be in the right mood to fully enjoy this game and that simply wasn't the case for me right now. Anyway, it's still a decent little title.

**Finding Paradise**

Kan Gao really knows how to tell an emotional story...

As in his previous game, To The Moon, you take control of Dr. Eva Rosalene und Dr. Neil Watts of Sigmund Corp. on their quest to alter their patient's memories, so they can relive a brighter past before they pass away. This time around, you have to deal with Colin Reeds, an ex-airline pilot, husband and father. As it turns out, Colin is a rather special case because rather than having granted a specific wish, he doesn't really want that the scientists change much of his memories. Instead, it's much more a series of smaller regrets he'd like to change. So in order to figure out what these regrets could be, Eva and Neil travel through his memories to find out what they need to change.

And that's actually most of what you need to know because games made by Kan Gao don't really offer much gameplay. They are more akin to a visual novel so it's all about experiencing the story that is being told. So yeah most of what you do is running around in a level, witness how the story progress and at the end of level, you solve a little puzzle to get to the next stage. However, they added some typical gameplay elements to make their title more like... well like a video game. It's not much but they still are some nice additions (though they don't make much of a difference...).

Well it's a good thing that the story is quite enjoyable with well written characters and a storyline that deals with problems you don't typically see in a video game. But nonetheless, the developers managed to write a wholesome story that is worth every penny you paid for it. I'm really glad I played it. Beautiful game.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643584293.0
"Bioshock infinite : 

With bioshock infinite I come to ending of playing through the bioshock trilogy for the first time. Infinite has to be most divisive game I have played cause it looks absolutely beautiful and I was engaged with the story from start to end ( until I had to go to YouTube and understand wtf was happening). I think people were right when they say that infinite does feel rushed and it could have been fleshed out definitely more. Songbird should have been more prevalent considering how important he was to the story and some more interactions with comstock. I was looking forward to boys of silence cause everyone said they were tough ( which they were as compared to cameras from the first two games ) only to find out that he just made enemies nearby hostile while I was expecting a tougher fight ( albeit I was playing in normal difficulty ). Overall bioshock infinite felt very fun and engaging to play for me although it played nothing like the first two games in any way whatsoever with plasmids being replaced vigors and more fleshed out in terms of uses which was a positive. Bioshock infinite is a very fun and engaging game to play but it’s potential is unmatched cause when you play the game you can see what it can be and that makes you disappointed even though it’s very fun. 

Burial at sea part 1:
Burial at sea P1 played similar to infinite but just with more scarcity of resources and I liked the beginning of the dlc due to it as it provided more tension and made you feel you were truly back in rapture which looked beautiful with infinite graphics . I could not complete the last 10 minutes due to a bug but I watched the rest on YouTube and I missed a pretty good fight :( 

Burial at sea part 2: 
I liked how you now play as Elizabeth and it’s pretty much all stealth but as someone who is not really into stealth didn’t like it that much but I just want to keep playing so that I can finish the story . I feel like it was a very good send off to the series in terms of story and it tied up everything together nicely . I just wanted my melee to kill which was not a backstab instead of a stun on enemies which hardly mattered as they were back up quick. Stealth could have been fleshed out more but as someone who is not really into stealth I liked the simple system",2,sg5z8f,0,1643618203.0
"**Gears Tactics**

On the last game in my Gears of War franchise playthrough. I've played through most of Tactics before, but never finished it. I'm still blown away how much it both looks and feels like a Gears game despite the gameplay going from a cover-based third-person shooter to a turn-based strategy game without it feeling out of place or like a gimmick. It's genuinely impressive. Game is great. I guess the reference for most people when it comes to turn-based strategy games is XCOM, so it's basically like that but with a much bigger emphasis on aggression, narrative-driven story instead of emergent stories, fleshed-out characters, the base-building is removed, and surprisingly has actual boss fights. The game opens up shortly before the Hammer of Dawn Strikes and continues from there, so I think it's actually the earliest game in the timeline. Anyway. Great game, would highly recommend to anyone who likes Gears or turn-based strategy games.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643626978.0
"**Icey**

I picked this up several years after having watched (and remembered) TotalBiscuit's good first impression video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWtX1FQ_U64

It's an achievement hunter's game; you are rewarded (for not doing what the narrator tells you) with achievements and 'meta' commentary on gaming, game development, and freedom of choice. I didn't feel like I got much out of it that I hadn't gotten elsewhere, in games, criticism, or other media, but I did play along and I did want to finish (had to use a guide to get the last few achievements I was missing and make sure I saw all the content) so that counts in it's favor.

My criticisms having finished it; the English voice of the narrator is horrible, I switched it to Japanese. The 'story' is pretentious (probably on purpose?), just an excuse for you to explore and rebel against the narrator, which is the real game.

Did it live up to what I what I built it up to be in my head after all these years? Yes and no. The game does have heart, despite not being entirely original, and being very low budget.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643944162.0
"Just replaying **Uncharted 4: A Thief's End** as part of the Legacy of Thieves collection. Even with a very minor visual upgrade and boost to 60fps, this is still one of the best looking games out there, and it came out, what, 6 years ago? Still looks incredible.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643962916.0
"Finished **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** - finally. Good game - no doubt about that, but imho massively overrated with titles like ""best game of all time"".

----------------------------------

The only thing where it is exemplary is the world building. It constantly keeps you curious what's here, what's there with distinct landscape features, objects, structures, buildings, etc. 

Sadly the rest is either just average or just good and first victim despite stellar world building is that there is not much interesting to find anywhere - it's either shrine, some boring loot, more arrow or some minerals  or other materials. Armors are by far best done items, but you buy most of them from vendors so they don't improve sense of discovery at all. 

Combat is passable, nothing to brag about, but enemy variety was highly disappointing by most being just recolored few types of enemies either using different weapon or having more HP and DMG. The bosses tho were pretty good and enjoyable.

Also - it's focused way too much on hoarding basically everything you possibly can pick up, as you need countless stuff for all sorts of upgrades (and playing blind you obviously can't know what exactly you will need and when). So that for sure felt super excessive and quite annoying in the end. This also made horse useless basically, not that limited distance you can call the horse helped it in any way either - seriously one of the worst mount implementations I've seen in any game.

Story felt very typical cookie cutter ""save the princess"" with not much originality in it. If not 4 distinct kingdoms with distinct characters I'd say it's even bad, but that saves it a lot. Side quests - dear god most were just straight up terrible with such an ass rewards. Only shrine quests were more clever and engaging as you had to figure basically a riddle. As for the shrines themselves - way too repetitive a lot of the time, with very simple puzzles - for my taste, way too easily and lacking diversity. 

All in all good game seriously carried by stunning world building and dragged down by everything else basically and having immense room for improvements - I just can't see how it can be crowned best game of all time - that's just complete insanity of people who did not likely play anything outside of Nintendo games. 

-------------------------------------------

Imho it's typical 8/10 game, had a good time with it but also had several disappointments and annoyances, where it literally begs for various improvements. Also played it on CEMU - rock solid 60fps with a lot of visual enhancements - so that improved the experience by a ton.",14,sg5z8f,0,1643543898.0

"I've tried **Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight** because I was in the mood for a sidescroller and this one has been sitting in my Steam library for years and is highly acclaimed for some reason. Played it for around an hour, seems very unremarkable so far. Visuals and controls are decent, combat is okay but rather simplistic (and I've read it stays that way), hardly any music and story, or characters with more personality beyond saying two sentences. Bosses have been okay so far. My problem is that the game just feels lifeless to be honest and not in an atmospheric way. I think I'll leave it at that.",5,sg5z8f,0,1643544739.0
"**Battlefield2042**

I only have played Battlefield 1, its a great game and my only real point of reference of the series. Tried Battlefield 4 and V in EA gamepass but didnt play them a lot, liked V, is a gorgeous game. 

I downloaded this game on the EA gamepass as a joke. I saw a lot of reviews that said it was the worst battlefield and wanted to see how badly they fucked it up.

Im having a blast. I havent encountered big bugs, maybe because i dont like to play vehicles. The game runs fine for me, the action is nice and i really dont see the problem with it. You can run a sniper rifle and have anti-tank weapons at the same time, which is great because i didnt like having to die in order to change class and have an oportunity against tanks and vehicles when playing recon or doctor. Dont have problems with specialist or classes, i think they give interesting perks. Like the maps, some have a nice verticality to it. There is crossplay so a lot of people is playing.

I dont like that the teams are divided by country or a group of countries and the specialist dont reflect that, if im playing russia i would like to have a russian specialist, but thats a aesthetic problem that isnt killing the enjoyment for the game. Im buying it.",5,sg5z8f,0,1643642318.0
"**Return of the Obra Dinn**

I picked this game up because I saw it recommended many times on Reddit, and the reviews looked good. But I don’t really see the appeal.. I loved the music and the art was unique - but I just wasn’t into the voice acting/story overall. That said, I did two play through and got my platinum. But the game was just ok at best in my opinion.

**Mass Effect 2**
Playing the series for the first time. I really enjoyed the story in the first one. I know people say the combat improves in the second one.. but I don’t know I kinda enjoyed the weapons and combat better in the first. Maybe it takes time to get used to the new upgrade system. Also it seems the story so far is just recruiting my team - while the first game had more of a story. Love the universe of the game so I can’t complain!",4,sg5z8f,0,1643649569.0
"**Time Loader**

I saw the game on a stream, it looked alright and I got it on sale this week. It's short, I finished in less than three hours, 5 hours to 100% (with a bunch of bugs and wasted time).

The premise is, a kid falls from his tree house and gets paralyzed and as an adult invents a time machine and sends you (a small robot) back in time to fix it. The robot can drive, jump, has an arm to grab, gets upgrades (like higher jump) and more.

The controls are not precise enough for my tastes and you can soft lock because it looks like you're stuck. Parts of that are on me, because sometimes you just need to wait for your character to settle down and you can move normally, although at times it's the exact opposite.

The game is a bit buggy, it has some minor physics glitches, but the important thing is the jump, sometimes it doesn't work correctly (this is tied to my comment with imprecise controls). There was also one part where the prompt for the next objective wouldn't load and I couldn't progress. I tried restarting the checkpoint a bunch, restarting from earlier in the game, nothing worked. Relaunching the game eventually fixed it, but it wasted too much time.

It's also not really difficult, it starts out with really simple puzzles, you just find the one thing that you can interact with and do the thing, some later ones have a few things that you need to do in the right sequence. Because it's not difficult, but sometimes slow and you know what to do and just wait for it to happen, it can get tedious, like many of these kinds of puzzle games. I get impatient, try to save time, fail, and everything takes longer.

If it was a bit more polished I'd like it more, but in it's current state if I hadn't gotten it on sale I'd probably be disappointed.

**Anno 1800**

I played the game on release, had one long sandbox session, but didn't touch it after that. For some reason I bought the DLC for the game during various sales, so I decided to finally give it another shot.

The way I've kinda always played the Anno games is, I only do the sandbox mode, disable other AI players, turn down the difficulty options as low as possible and just go. I don't think I've touched the campaigns or different scenarios more than a handful of times, even going back to Anno 1602 or 1503.

This time I also installed a few mods, mainly some low impact, more QoL stuff, but there's some that I absolutely underestimated, that turned out pretty broken, although I don't really care too much, since I'm pretty much playing creative mode-ish anyway.

So right now I'm just slowly building my cities. I just recently made it to the New World and started expanding there. There are absolutely no stakes, pretty much no risk and it's great for me to play it in short sessions and have some fun.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643541208.0
"Finished Resident Evil 7. Not a perfect game (I got off on kind of on the wrong foot with it, because I got stuck for a while after a early game trigger just wouldn't pop) but a damn good one. Fun, pulpy horror with great production values, solid, intense gameplay, and the best story any RE game has ever had. (Not an especially high bar, that last one, but still) About all you'd really want from a Resident Evil game.

This really felt like the game where Capcom finally managed to get its shit together again and started making consistently solid titles that appealed to long-term fans of the franchise while still bringing in some influence from western games and ideas that helped make the games accessible to a new audience. (Then again, MvC Infinite came out after this so there's that)

Oh yeah, and I briefly played Shadow Warrior 2013. That game feels terrible. I'm sure it was better at the time when those sort of throwback shooters were much rarer, but it's real rough playing it today. I think there's something decent in there somewhere, so I'll keep an eye out for Shadow Warrior 3. (People seemed to really hate 2, even fans of the previous game)",4,sg5z8f,0,1643551486.0
"**The Great Ace Attorney 2** - I finished it and what a ride! It's always cool to play these games and have what seems to be disjointed stuff all pull together at the end, and what a grand end! I will say it's a bit weird that the game completely drops the jury at the end (though for a reason) just because that was the main gameplay innovation and we lose it for the usual prosecutor v defence battle of the normal games. In practice, I don't think the Jury system added anything to the games but more dialogue. Having to beg the jury did nothing more than add some cheap tension and a way to waste a couple of minutes as you do the same thing you normally do but with a different objective.

Similarly, having more than one person in the booth and it being BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS when you need to pursue something with someone else added little challenge. I believe the jury thing is from when Ace Attorney did a crossover with Professor Layton but as a gameplay addition, I think the last best thing was in AA4 with Apollo's bracelet. Looking for tics/giveaways (especially with that creepy music) was actually really neat and added something to change up the usual ""the answer is probably present evidence on the 4th or 5th answer"".

Also, I'm surprised we never got another episode like the one with Cosney Megundal where you analyse the stagecoach. That one was really good as it hid a lot of things in the coach and being able to really look around and investigate that brought something that previous games couldn't because you had full models to play around with. In this, you're back to the same ol, gather all the evidence, go to court, rinse repeat.

I think the series could do more with the investigation elements and there's certainly ideas ripe for doing more with evidence, etc. It might be best for the series, if they did another game, to get away from the established cast and do something fresh like how GAA did. 

As I say that, the ending for GAA2 does feel like there's more for Ryunosuke and co especially now that Ryu has gotten his confidence (so we can certainly end his terrible animation of when he gets shocked, he does the whole ""I've been shot ahhhh"" thing).
I doubt the series is done but I bet anyone involved is really hesitant to make another game now that all of the games plots have been wrapped up nice and neat. To add another game using those established characters is brave. My advice? Just get away from those guys and make a new game and change the formula.

**Ape Escape 3** - Been on a PS2 kick since I've beaten Yakuza 1. First up was Ape Escape 3. I had missed the game when it came out years ago and I missed dearly those mechanics. It's such a good silly game, I'm surprised we just don't get these fun games more anymore. Sure, it's too kiddy and far too easy (am I crazy or was Ape Escape 1 a much tougher game?) but catching those monkeys is still so much fun. 

It's weird though, the stages don't seem to demand much from the player gadget wise. It feels like they made the stages and then remembered that using the gadgets to traverse the environment is important so very few monkeys demand much skill to capture. 

One other weird thing, the lady in charge of the lab this time is Aki...and...look...it seems like the devs really gave her some big ol breasts. It's a bit odd as it has kid main characters and the difficulty is minimal but here's some big uns for the men. It gets really distracting when her model is side on as they're distractingly large. Reminded me of the many kids shows having one thing very sexual like Powerpuff girls having Ms. Bellum or Dexter's Lab having Dexter's mum.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643576531.0
"**Not for Broadcast**: Now that it's released, I have put a couple of hours into it, and the FMV as a TV control room guy has been great. Challenging, comedic, and poignant. Also this has the most accessibility features of any game I have ever played.

**Fall Guys**: I maxed out my XP/fame, and seeing the reminder to progress the season to get certain characters has me hoping that the season won't be as long as the last one.

**Solitairica**: Solitare type card game with roguelite elements that works well with Steam Link and I can find myself playing it semi mindlessly in a good way. I beat the game once with an early deck and am trying to beat it with a 3rd deck that I have maxed out on upgrading.

**Shape of the World**: This is No Man's Sky if it were serene instead of ""chill"", took place on a single planet with multiple biomes, used pop-in artistically, and made the game short enough for most people to enjoy playing through it. The ""soundtrack"" is far less dynamic than NMS though, as its only dynamic qualities rely mostly on player actions.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643730523.0
"**Halo Infinite:**  Fairly solid campaign all-around. Doesn't do anything new or crazy, but the Halo gameplay is all there with a bevy of fun weapons to mess with. The enemy AI is quite good, and I really like all their banter. Halo games on Heroic always felt perfect to me, but Infinite is just a smidge too challenging/frustrating, or at least certain parts are (specifically some of the boss fights and that room with two hunters). Can't even imagine trying to do it on Legendary. Bleargh. 

The story was fine, although it was mostly just world-building and set up for the next game. Lots of great mocap acting. Dunno how to feel about the new Cortana. I understand she's supposed to be cute/quirky but I found her mannerisms kinda annoying. Overall, I had fun though. 8/10.

**R6 Extraction:**  Gave this another fair shot, and it's actually pretty decent with a fair amount of depth to it as you progress. Not super amazing or anything but since it's 'free' on Game Pass....

"Currently playing **DIABLO 2 RESURRECTED**. After it's initially poor launch week with server connection issues reminiscent of the old battlenet days, it's been rock solid since. Finally, blizzard made an update of an old classic that is true to the original with all the promise of enhanced graphics, animations, and sound effects, with a few QoL changes that players really wanted. The only thing they did remove which I felt bad about was LAN play, but since it has a very niche use case I'm not too upset about it. It seems like they are going forward, developing patches and supporting game play balancing to fix the various scaling and character deficiencies that originally were never addressed. Their chat system still exhibits spam, which I honestly thought I wouldn't see in the new version, and the filters to block them are not sufficient, a small gripe.

I'm also getting back into **Total War: WARHAMMER 2**, in anticipation for TWWH3, though I have doubts whether I will even pick it up. I've forgotten how complex this game was. Now retraining all my old routines in the game and relearning the user interface, it's surprising how clumsy some of the game components are and remember why mods for this game were so critical to its success.

Finally having a decent enough card to run **RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2** smooth and detailed, it's an enjoyable game with good writing, dialogue, voice acting, interesting set pieces, characters and locations. 

**CONTROL** was another game I put on the back burner until I had the gear to run smoothly. Very nice level designs, intriguing story, great atmosphere, spooky, quirky and trippy, this is a game very much up my alley. A little too heavy on the reading, but it's enjoyable reading, every document has a hint of the strange.

With the deluge of poorly finished titles being released by major publishers, the hardware market going sideways, the heavy monetizations, as well as some that are only on consoles only to be released for PC later, it seems to me that my gaming habits have changed over the decades. I wait long after titles are released to see the variety of detailed reviews, and wait until the top notch gear at the time becomes old tech to buy cheap. I don't think I will ever buy any games at launch anymore. Too many problems with new titles.",4,sg5z8f,0,1643550410.0
"**Mass Effect**

Ever since Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has been on Xbox Game Pass, all my game time is spent on those games.

Mass Effect (1) is not an outstanding game by any means and time certainly hasn’t been kind to it, gameplay-wise. Those that said Andromeda had worse combat that ME1 (or 2, for that matter) are completely insane. All that being said, it still holds up story-wise and the save importing gimmick is very, very fun, especially now that you can play all three games in a row effortlessly.

Mako still sucks, side missions are still a waste of time. Didn’t like that the Remaster didn’t try to fix more issues with the game or improve the UX but it is what it is. 

Overall, I had a good time with it but I would be lying if I didn’t want to get over it and move on to ME2.

This is the most intense digital entertainment experience I've had in years. The story, the world, the characters - but also the insane combat, weapons, hacking system - it's all so wonderful. I'm now at 40+ hours and I'm getting more invested by the day. Usually I lose interest in games nowadays after the 10 hour mark and here it's only getting better.

That said it's incredibly ugly, the story is dumb and the gameplay very simple. Still having tons of fun exploring and catching pokemon, hard to explain why

**Guardian of the Galaxy**, Finished it, the game is so beautiful and fun overall. I dream that they would put the team behind that on a new SF IP like mass effect because this game was closer than an old Bioware game than  anything in years. A small team with great interaction, but serious when it matters (they all have past trauma), with choices that matters on the story (a bit) and visiting gorgeous environment. The gameplay is ok, I put it on normal and did not bother much with it, the exploration is god of war light type (almost corridor with collectable)

**Ori and the will of the Wisp** Started it and played a few hours. You're very quickly into action and upgrade, in less than an hour I have multiple spell like double jump, wall jump and many other. I'm a bit sad that they went and kind of copied Hollow knight instead of being diffferent like the first one. You have a sword than is like the nail of hollow knight and you get perk like hollow knight. The world is also a lot more grim that the first one. Kind of disapointed, I wanted more of ori, not a reskin of hollow knight. 


**God of war** I had a really negative impression last week after playing for an hour+ but I sticked with it (I'm after Alfheim) like u/ravinglt0 advised and the game did get better. It opens a bit and you get a little bit of liberty, the story also widen a lot and is a more interesting. Fighting is pretty messy but fun, I feel like I'm cheesing the game sometimes, since you can almost bit every hard encounter just throwing your axe repeatildy (when they are level 6 and you level 2 for example).

Little things like the inflexibility of the two action system or restrictive soldier classes irritated me. But on the other hand, this game is no holds barred fun. In my opinion Phoenix Point improved on a great many of its mechanics, but that game leaves fun by the wayside a bit with how brutal its combat can be and the limb targeting system that doesn't really bring enough to justify how much it stunts the pace of the core gameplay loop. I really hope we can see a game one day with the best of both worlds.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643565262.0
"The late mid-week didn't seem that exiting, but still was a bit playable. 

Sunday: **Gyruss**, C64 version, with score of 70800. It is a tunnel shooter, where you fight against targets (similar to Galaxians) as you make warps to Earth. 

This was a game where I previously completed decades ago by reaching Earth and starting a new loop, thus one might think I might not have encountered anything fresh.  This was not the case - I was caught off-guard after I mostly destroyed waves in their approach phase, when a fifth wave appeared using an unexpected pattern.  In any case, redoing this old run won't be easy, as it still requires relearning all the old patterns.

Monday: **Badlands**, Amiga version, a single-screen racing game which follows the standard expectation that the player must always rank first. 

While there seems to be a good selection of tracks, the implementation feels a little basic, especially after having been exposed to other combat racers such as *Death Rally*, or anything starting in the PC era. 

Tuesday: **Cosmic Rochambo**, from an itch.io bundle. I had to look this one up again, because I forgot about the gameplay - it's a 1v1 combat game where the players ram each other and try to throw the other into the arena's edge. 

The chief problems - no sound or music, and the settings screen doesn't seem to allow enabling them. The default AI level seems to be a bit hard, 

Wednesday: **Super Win the Game**, from an itch.io bundle. It's a platformer, which introduces overworld movement to make the game look more expansive rather than just being a single map, and that improves its quality. 

For this session, the CRT simulation filter caught my attention. For some reason, it seems a little exaggerated, perhaps because I'm recalling those old games as sharper than what seems to be depicted in those CRT filters - usually lacking the scanline or blur effects. Part of this may have been playing those older games on a modern CRT which didn't have those effects, or even with the old computer CRTs not having that type of effects (while the old TV screens did.) 

Thursday: **[My Personal Hilopet](https://hilovids.itch.io/hilopet)**, which was bundled but is still free-to-play. It's reminiscent of the Tamagotchi toys, but introduces some combat system. 

Some of the game elements feel a bit too needy - the poop cleanup appeared too frequently in my play despite not knowing how to feed him, and it also seems to require money to clean up as well (which also cuts into training.) 

Friday: **[Kiwi](https://moonrift.itch.io/kiwi)**, an endless runner. It does have a few puns going for it - flying a kiwi who throws kiwis at targets, but it doesn't feel like it has standing power.  Hitboxes are a bit wide too. 

Of note, I started with 100 coins, and managed to purchase the one-time upgrade in the shop, before finding out that I needed to use the tutorial to figure out the control set. The coin regain rate was also a bit too slow for me. 

Saturday: **Lost Labyrinth**, a roguelike. It's an older version, and it seems the main branch is now only available on Steam - I'm uncertain if this was the best version before switching to commercial, because the game is behaving awkwardly with the mouse pointer in Windowed mode (it loses capture easily and requires task switching to bring it back.) 

The roguelike does have good variety, although it feels like the difficulty ramp is a bit mid-heavy, especially since it feels like there's only a limited amount of torches and lighting. It also seems to require a walkthrough, considering that it seems quite easy to make an incorrect character build by the time the difficulty ramp hits; most other roguelikes instead seemed to have their wall based around improper caution rather than character builds. 

Oh, and noticed that *Nethack* wasn't in the list of games. Turned out that was missing because it wasn't installed on the local computer when I started checking which games I had available.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643569814.0

**Pokemon Legends Arceus - Switch**

Feels pretty fresh when compared to brilliant diamond. I was afraid that it was going to feel a lot more like BotW with an awful lot of emptiness inbetween a couple of interesting areas.

But its somewhere between that and monsterhunter instead with going in to different maps/areas and hunting for pokemon.

The setting is great and cyndaquil being back made choosing a starter a no-brainer for me. Combat feels better/faster since its seamless to get into it from running around looking for pokemon and crafting materials.

"**The Ruined King: League of Legends (Switch)**

Never played League, but I liked what I saw from watching my roommate play it.

Overall, 6/10, I'd say. The basic gameplay is fun but a tad easy. I only game over'd twice & once was on purpose.

The dungeons were mostly too small and none of them really had any kind of gimmick, which made them even less memorable. Your character has two movement speeds: slow & less slow and with the size of some of the hub maps, it can get really tiresome walking from point A to point B. There is a fast travel system but it's based on taxi gondolas or finding & activating teleporters.

The combat is neat and has definite shades of the devs' last project, Battle Chasers. You build Overcharge Points with regular attacks and can use them instead of Magic Points. Spells/skills can be cast in three lanes - Speed (fast but weaker), Balance (one guess what this does), and Power (slow but strong), and some enemies have to be hit with one or more specific lane attacks to dispel buffs. Sometimes enemies will cast a debuff that will harm someone using certain lanes. There's also an action timeline charting who goes when & large blocks of the timeline can fill with a buff of debuff, incentivizing you to choose actions carefully.

There's a good amount of character customization as well. You get Ability Points and Runes as you level up, and each passive & active skill has 3 levels with two choices per level to spend AP on. The Runes are largely passives, like ""+5% Attack"" or ""adds 600 Bleed Damage on critical hits"". The better passives need more Runes and each character has two pages of Rune passives, and you get different, extra buffs depending on which page you pump Runes into.

Each character also unique combat & overworld mechanics. The overworld stuff is not used often - I think I saw maybe two translatable texts for Illaloi - and Pyke's ""hit overworld enemy symbol for bonus"" skill may be accurate to LoL but is almost worthless in a game where chaining battles is *desired*. But in combat they're all pretty fun. Illaloi summoning tentacles for several turns then cashing 'em out for BIG DAMAGE or smacking an enemy with Ahri's orb and seeing like 5 debuffs pop... noice.

The Switch port is decent but has some big problems. The long-ass load times make the slow walking feel worse. I accidentally triggered a fight with a way lower level enemy and ended up underneath the map after the encounter. Another area, I kept getting stuck in place after encounters and had to keep switching party leader & spamming their attack to free myself.

Also some quests either bug out temporarily or just appear too early *or* are poorly signposted. The Void Jumper bounty felt broken until I dug around and learned you have to go to 4 seemingly random spots to do a thing, then go to another area when the bounty contacts you.

Also that Countess quest- unless it's just broken, what the fuck??? Who designed a quest in an RPG where if you actually try to complete it, the game laughs at you and gives you a super unsatisfactory non-conclusion? This ain't MOON: A Remix RPG.

The final boss made me wonder if I had missed something again, as it wasn't hard & had like, 1 unique gimmick. At the least I thought >!there'd be a second form but...!<",2,sg5z8f,0,1643587719.0
"**Vampire Survivors**

Motivated by the recent thread and low low price, I picked it up and sunk about 3.5 hours into it immediately. It has a definite addictive quality to it. The gameplay is simple (mostly movement and facing) and is perfect for getting in the zone and letting time pass. I used a gamepad for comfort.

It's Early Access and I have limited experience so I can't comment much on balance or what their balance goals even are, but it's definitely easier with some characters and unlocks, like most roguelikes. Right now though it seems like a perfect podcast accompaniment.

**Dark Souls 2 [no SoTFS]**

The ""bad"" one. After getting my booster and being far too sleepy to do Demon Prince at SL1 in DS3 I thought I'd go back to this since it's been years. Was it as bad as everyone keeps saying?

My first surprise was that I have almost as much time logged in Steam in DS2 as DS3 and Sekiro combined. I have all achievements. I must have played the hell out of it back in the day. I vaguely remember trying to make PvP work and giving up with AU ping.

This time I went with the cheesy Rapier counter build just to keep things simple, I wanted to get through all the areas quickly and refresh my memory.

And what I remembered is how much I actually enjoy this one. If it didn't have the Souls branding I think it would be one of the greats. It just introduced so many new concepts, some of them jarring. It gets flack for losing the interconnected feel of the world but is DS3 really better? Just just trade Majula for the High Wall as the hub.

It definitely has issues. AGI is terrible. The combat is really fluid but the lack of queuing means a few times I've tried to use items and they just don't work. Lock-on is more of a suggestion and I'll often stab thin air right next to a guy after a roll. The bosses sometimes don't deserve to be called such because they're so easy, but they definitely went for quantity over quality with over 30 bosses compared to around 20 in DS3 and they still have some good ones. Item durability is awful. Being unable to hit short enemies when locked on is also particularly annoying.

But it was also creative. New enemies and items in NG+, and bonfire ascetics for making just one area NG+. Pharros lockstones to help telegraph some ""secrets"". Generally smooth combat feel leading to popular PvP. Lowered hollow HP to stop zerg strats is something I'm sure most of us hate but I see why they did it (you can train as long as you want, but go human for your real attempts). Bonfire placement is generally quite good and I don't recall any terrible boss runs, and although it removed the feeling of danger I think most of us prefer having quick travel. Forcing us into carrying ranged options for comfort (not really required, but archer placement and stuff like Shrine of Amana make it very recommended). Environmental effects on resistance. Powerstancing. 4 rings. Life gems.

So while it gets panned a lot as the worst, I have a soft spot for games that try even if they fail. I can't argue that DS3 is more polished, and more of the bosses are memorable. But I might actually enjoy DS2 more.

For my online needs, quite active servers luckily.  I like Battlefield 1 more but this is little something else for taking a break from 1.

Having played almost 10 hours my opionions of this game has improved. It is still poor mans FF Tactics/ Tactics Ogre but since getting more levels/ skills/ gear  and having harder story battles game has improved.  Music is good, story is kinda bleh, characters alright. Luckily there are different routes and from what I see from achievements there will be hard and insane mode added after completion.

Great hack'n slash game but unfortunately with some technical issues (Xbox). It crashed every few hours and after my first playthrough I stopped playing hoping for a few patches.

I like the way the world looks, a lot of the secondary characters have a goofy charm, flying around and being able to dive off your bird into town or onto an island is a an enjoyable way to get around. However then I got to the first dungeon and dungeon boss and it just really brought to the forefront the things that I don't enjoy - how the camera works and how combat works [with a joystick]. Unfortunately those are some pretty core components of the game lol. Despite it being technically more interactive I think the combat just feels lifeless as the enemies aren't really proactive and it's almost more of a target practice minigame than anything else. I also just can't get used to how the sword and joystick interact - maybe there's an inverted control scheme I can try or something. That being said I'm 'only' 6hours in and maybe it's just a matter of getting used to it and maybe there's a payoff later but I'm just not feeling very enthusiastic about it.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643905921.0

I'm still having issues with higher difficulties, but judging by the teammates I've been getting, so are they. A match can quickly turn into a massive clusterfuck and half the fun is trying to survive and/or still complete the objective and/or extract any KO'd teammates.

"I'm finally playing **Pokemon Legends: Arceus**. 

I am having a ton of fun! There are so many QoL updates that I hope are carried in the next titles - swapping moves on the fly, evolving whenever you want, level ups/new moves in the background, seamless battles, reworked EVs. They streamlined so many things and made all the tedious part quicker or non-existent so we can focus on catching and battling. It's great. 

The new battle system is... ok, I guess. Styles are fun, the Pokemon are tough, and dodging enemies and throwing Pokeballs is engaging. I'd say overall I prefer the old battle system but there are some elements future games could borrow from this. There is much less emphasis on battles compared to past titles though, so even if the combat is less interesting, it's not as big of a deal. I do miss abilities and held items a lot though, as well as multi-target moves for those pesky 3-4 on one encounters (unlike hordes in ORAS, those Pokemon still hit HARD). 

I really like the new designs, gen 8 continues to take the worst gen (5) and make it better. The story is nothing to write home about. Past Pokemon titles had really interesting characters, this one less so and the designs are a bit of an eye sore which is weird because Pokemon usually has great character design. The music is also slightly disappointing, less memorable than usual but it's also party because it tries too much to be like BotW at times but it actually shines whenever it's not. 

As for the hot button - graphics. They are *fine*. I think Pokemon works best when it tries to emulate the anime in terms of art style. This game has the same plastic-y feel that I didn't like in Let's Go or Snap. The colours are washed out, the whites are greys, poor Arcanine looks like it's been playing in dirt all the time. Sword and Shield's bright colours were better. It definitely needs more thought and work if they're gonna stick with this. 

Overall it's an incredibly solid title. Space time distortions should make everyone who wanted a more difficult game happy, there's more story and lore than I thought there'd be and the new Pokemon are cool.

"**Final Fantasy XIV**


I recently weaned myself off *Destiny 2*, either for good or until the Witch Queen expansion in a little while. 


One of the games on my list to try for the last year was Final Fantasy XIV. 


I had played a trial 4 years ago for about a week. I think I was at the time overwhelmed with the playstyle and it didnt mesh with me. I think I felt in a rush to get to max level cap - as is the way with WoW - and felt like I was missing out without it. The HUD was confusing. My ping was wildly too high. I thought the map system was too confusing - turned out I started in Limsa Lomisa and that is a particular beast to traverse.


So after noticing the feedback from the Dev community events, streamer praise and addition of OCE servers, I've been excited to give it a second chance


I wish I had sooner! The amount of content is staggering, the user experience is streamlined - as if the developers have a good knowledge of the MMO landscape - and they made crafting/gathering something I look forward to! 


The soundtrack and effects are nostalgic (for someone who has played previous FF games) and soothing (like Stardew V or Animal Crossing). It's a great looking game aswell - for someone only on the first zones of the game! 

The only downsides I've experienced are due to my own choices - I rushed to collect each trade and gathering job/class and filled up my inventory bag quickly. I have just unlocked retainers (the 'bank' system in FF) so this will alleviate my issues. 
I also noticed I'm grossly over-levelled for the main story quests - but that is because I'm on a 'new' server that has built in exp boosts and because I decided to do every quest in sight for the first 20 hours!",1,sg5z8f,0,1643784779.0

"[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/saqc9g/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/htwagtt/)

**Call of Duty 3** (PS2) - The final game in the 'Call of Duty Trilogy' for the PlayStation 2 and I think it's the middling game of the collection - better than Finest Hour but not as good as Big Red One. I think it's probably the weakest of the 'mainline series' too, I'd almost certainly rank 1 and 2 above it. I finished it on 'Normal' difficulty.

It's a bit of a tricky game to talk about because a lot of it blurs into one. The game does the traditional hopping between various units and characters but this time, it's all themed around one campaign - the post-D-Day Battle of Normandy. It tells the story of the closing of the Falaise Gap and the push to Chambois. I like the idea in theory - shining a light on more obscure battles is something I'm a fan of - but in practice it means going through a lot of same-y French villages and fields. Only a few things really stick out in my mind; a forest that feels like a jungle, a hill level where you're continually pushed backwards.

I like some gameplay changes but I'm not a fan of others. Occasionally you get to make a choice of what path you want to take through a level, which is good. I don't like how most of the non-on-foot gameplay has been stripped out; there's only 1 and an eighth of tank levels this time around (and the default tank controls feel like a step down from other entries). There's some driving sections in the British campaign which are fun and are one of the highlights, though they felt a bit like moving through the set of Postman Pat. There's no air missions like in United Offensive or Big Red One - I think the game could have done with stuff like that to break it up a bit. There's quick time events which force you to occasionally spend 30 seconds mashing buttons to dispatch an enemy at close quarters, or to set charges. Mortar controls are done through rotating the analogue sticks. I can see why these were included as attempts at increasing immersion, but they break up the flow a bit, and there's not much variation each time they come up. I also think that the regenerating health aspect led to the developers including a ton of machine gun turrets which got a bit repetitive after a while. I continue to like the 'team' aspect as well - one level where I did one objective while my AI companions did another surprised me.

The narrative is OK. I like the inclusion of the Canadian and Polish regiments and I think the decision to go back to cutscenes like in Finest Hour is an interesting choice. It does allow the game to shuffle between regiments at the end of levels to show how they're progressing. I feel as though the game is still weighted too heavily towards the Americans - for example you only get two levels with the Polish team, and much of the character development comes in the American campaign. There are a few interesting beats with some British and Canadian characters but the Americans are clearly at the forefront. You start and finish the game with them. I like the continuity of the British campaign being a sequel to United Offensive. Too many levels end with someone calling in air support though - it got far too same-y by the end of the game.

There were also a few glitches and texture pop-in that I noticed too - perhaps a side effect of this being a previous-gen port. It ran well for the most part though and the guns were broadly fine. I prefer the sniper rifles but some of the machine guns like the Sten flail far too wildly to be effective. I also had a habit of mixing up the AI gun-fire with AI turret fire as the flashes weren't distinct enough. It's not a bad game but I think that it's a bit too repetitive and I find the other mainline games more memorable. I suppose it does put a decent capper on the WWII era of games, with a nice call-back to where the entire series started in the last level. Next up will be Call of Duty 4 which I'll try on my laptop (one of my relatives owns the remastered version so I'll use that if it won't run) - I may try and track down the PSP spin-off of 3 one day.

**Insight** (PC) - Running out of road a bit here in this line drawing game. Now, out of the 49 total level areas I've unlocked 38 and fully completed 17 - progress is terribly slow. I think a break from this may be in order; I just can't understand what some of the symbols mean and I'm occasionally stumbling into the correct solutions without knowing how I've got there. With some puzzles combining symbols together, I'm hitting a bit of a dead end for the moment.

**Understand** (PC) - A combination of playing Insight and seeing Understand discussed elsewhere got me back into playing this Witness-like game. I think some time away from this (about half a year) helped me view the puzzles I was stuck on with fresh eyes - I finished off the last world 2 puzzles I couldn't previously do and I finally completed level 3-6 which set me on a patch to unlock a whole host of other puzzles. I knocked out 20 sets this week (some of which only took me a few minutes), though I still can't do the world 4 puzzles that I was previously stuck on. The theming of worlds 5, 7 and 9 just click with me a bit more; I can more easily get my head around the ideas presented in them. My completion percentage is now at 37.5% and I may have a look at some more puzzles this week, but it's a good feeling to not be completely stuck with no hope of progressing. I think I'm enjoying it a bit more than Insight, maybe it helps that each puzzle set has a new set of rules and they seem a bit more 'gettable'; there's only been one instance where I've completed a set without fully grasping the rules at play.",1,sg5z8f,1,1643556075.0

"Finished **Alan Wake Remastered** along with it's two DLC chapters. I found it to be immensely frustrating at times due to it's limited gameplay mechanics but ultimately I loved it and can't wait to see how Alan Wake 2 turns out. Definitely gonna replay Control soon so I can pick up on all the AW references.

Went really hard on **Ghost of Tsushima** this week as I finally got around to playing the Iki Island expansion and I've gotta say, it didn't really impress me. I appreciated the environments, the additional horse ability and the new side activities. The island itself is utterly gorgeous, and had some beautifully unique areas. But I just didn't care for the story at all. It lacked a lot of the artistic direction of the main game and I suspect COVID had a lot to do with that.

Right after finishing it I wanted to replay the main game just to experience it again and I totally forgot how well done that main campaign is. I played on NG+ and did nothing but story missions. Which, much like Horizon, makes the story flow much better when it isn't interrupted for hours on end doing side content. I finished it in 2 days and enjoyed revisiting it immensely.

I read a comment on one of these threads recently that said they wished the game had a choice system in regards to following the way of the Samurai, or the way of the Ghost. And while choice is always nice in games, giving the player this choice would undermine the whole point of the game and would make the story quite generic I feel.

Jin's conflict is the focal point of the game and it is beautifully done. And that final battle is so emotional and gut wrenching. I really hope they do a sequel and expand on this while also exploring the legend of the ghost reaching the mainland.

Finally, I did a quick run through of **Little Nightmares** again and this time tried out the three DLC chapters. I like Little Nightmares but not as much as Playdeads titles and I have no desire to play the sequel, unfortunately. It's atmosphere, art style and soundtrack are all impeccably done but the gameplay is too frustrating to really enjoy. Movement is so clunky and Six will sometimes just stop moving for no reason. Checkpoint restarts take WAY too long and I found myself mashing the controller buttons to just get Six to MOVE.

The DLC chapters were wildly varying in quality. Namely, the 1st and 3rd being very enjoyable with the 2nd being atrociously bad. The 1st one used water mechanics and this was a very enjoyable mechanic and introduced a nice twist to the gameplay. The 3rd expanded on the ""combat"" from the final boss of the main game in an Alan Wake inspired way. Basically you have a torch and have to dissolve dark beings with it. This turned up the tension in some areas and I enjoyed it.

The 2nd DLC had me tearing my hair out. This one introduced a follower mechanic which had you using the gnome characters to help you solve environmental puzzles. The problem is the AI is braindead and just doesn't fucking work most of the time. I genuinely hated the hour and a half I spent with it and vow to never play it again.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643631024.0
"Just got **Project Cars 2** on sale, which is an insane amount of content for 9 bucks. Going through the career mode starting with GT5 and just made it to GT4 with Aston Martin. The driving model is very solid, maybe a bit stiff on controller, but I haven't gotten into tuning yet so maybe that will help. I think one of the biggest problems with simcade racing in general is difficulty. The perfect balance of difficulty is usually very narrow with these games - either you're way out in front or absolute trash. I think part of the problem is that **Gran Turismo Sport** has kind of ruined single player racing for me. The intensity and fairness of online races in GTS is just completely unlike anything I've ever experienced in a racing game, and now the contrast between ai and human opponents is jarring. It feels bad when you're passing your opponents on the straight, not because you outsmarted them in the corner leading up to it, but because they are straight up handicapped and have noticably less power than you in the exact same car. All that's not to say that I'm not enjoying this game, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of racer. I guess it's just got me even more hyped for GT7",1,sg5z8f,0,1643643661.0

**Attack on Titan 2: Final Battle (Switch)**

Surprisingly fun for what is probably THE most repetitive game Koei has made as of yet. 

The movement is genuinely fun and zipping around the maps never really gets old. Combat however is a real one trick pony. You have just one attack, and you either attack the nape for a 1hit KO, or limbs to get materials, which makes every encounter a 1-3hit KO. 

Unfortunately, all characters are virtually identical. They only have different base stats(you can upgrade) or some unique stat altering passive skills and that's it. Gameplay wise: 0 difference.

As said, this is the most repetitive game Koei has ever made. All ""musou""(if you wanna count this as one) games are repetitive but this one takes the cake. Every mission is practically the same. You just kill Titans and then at the end there's the ""Large Abnormal"" with the green areas you need to hit first, to finish the mission. That's every mission, all missions. In many of them you can even walk straight to the Large Abnormal to finish it in like 2mins. Not doing so only affects your rank and rewards earned.

There's no mission variety. Some missions are dubbed defend missions but they follow the same procedure. They didn't even bother with mission structures most other musou games or spinoffs have as standard.

Speaking of rewards, they mostly only serve to unlock/upgrade equipment. But as you may know, the show only really uses one set of equipment. To still have that mechanic in the game, Koei introduced a wide variety of MMO-tier weapons like rotating clock blades or chainsaw swords.

The story mode is about 12hrs and is fun enough, but thats also about the longevity the game has due to the above mentioned repetitiveness in all regards.  

But here's the thing with the post-game or other game modes: the content doesn't fit the length of the game. 
For example, in the story mode you can max out friendship levels and some people then unlock new upgrades or buffs. Others are unlocked for playing them, with this method. However, the story mode isn't long enough to even do this for 1/3 of the characters, so you're left with a whole bunch of un-unlocked bases, characters or mission altering buffs. There's Territory Control Mode, in which you create your own regiment, start with nothing and then hire characters to your regiment as you go along. But its the same issue here: you're done with that mode before you've even acquired half the characters you want, or finished the upgrades on your base. Which makes the grind this game has the worst kind of grind: a completionist grind only for the sake of completion after you beat everything already. 

Despite that, it is fun enough (as long as it lasts), but this is in no way a game anybody should be paying $60 for.

**Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires Demo (Switch/PS4)**

Switch version first: holy shit this is a terrible port. The draw distance is literally 2ft ahead of the character and everything* just pops in right in front of you, the texture quality is horrid, as is the quality of the assets which makes the pop-ups even worse. The FPS are atrocious, and yet, they STILL have to dump the resolution down to make it blurry as hell on top of all of that. It is honestly a full B-I-N-G-O on the ""terrible Switch port"" bingo card.

Moving on to PS4. 

So this has two graphics modes now: action and movie mode. Movie mode also runs badly. Not as bad as Switch but action mode is the way to go. 

As most people, I disliked DW9 for the huge missed opportunity the game was. What everybody wanted was the usual DW gameplay and maps, only connected by an open world. But what we got were empty maps that had little squads of enemies here and there and offered MMO tier fetch quests. 

I heard that they apparently remedied some of this for the Empires version so I wanted to check it out. One of my many issues with DW9 was how redundant many mechanics were. For example, and IIRC as its been a while(and correct me if I misremember how this worked) , all the siege options you had were made redundant by the grappling hook as you could simply grapple in and kill the base leader and not having bother with the siege at all. Not so much an ""option"", as it was streamlining.

What they changed now is that the grappling hook is something you unlock during sieges. Your archers first have to take out the tower defenses for the hook to be available. And there's a lot more structure and procedures to the sieges now so thats at least a good thing.

However, everything else is still the same and I gotta be honest here, I didn't even finish the demo. My interest in this plummeted with each minute played. It just still feels like the same missed opportunity in so many regards. It didn't even satisfy the ""at least I can kill time with this"" itch.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643708476.0

Literally everyone plays it the right way, even on bad teams. The gameplay simply doesn't allow lone wolves (super long reload times while standing still/one-hit kills/impossible to charge a group on your own) so everyone forms battle lines and sticks together.

It shines when you have a full party of companions with a range of skills (at least one mage, a warrior to tank, etc) and micro-managing each person's actions. I think I usually set up the tactics in a basic way and then used the pause to make sure my companions were setting up the combos I wanted, playing it more like a turn-based game.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643562573.0

"> average or just good and first victim despite stellar world building is that there is not much interesting to find anywhere - it's either shrine, some boring loot, more arrow or some minerals or other materials. 

I kinda disagree with that on the premise that there's no other ow game out there, which's content is this integral to the core objective.

You really have only one objective: go to the castle and defeat Ganon. You can even skip everything and go straight there. But everything you find in the world is helping you with that. And not in the passive way that each game is doing it, but in an active way.

Like how the Koroks aren't a ""collectible"" but an integral part of the inventory system. The only reason there's so many of them is so that every player, no matter their playstyle, can find enough along the way to upgrade their inventory no problem. 

And that kinda examplifies why the game is so highly regarded. On the surface it doesn't seem like more care has been put into this than any other open world game, but if you examine it closer, you'll find it certainly has.

The often lamented shrines are also a perfect solution to not lock the player away for too long from the - now main part of the game - the overworld, while also providing puzzles, interesting mechanics and again, serve as a core element to upgrade your stats.

This core loop is what makes the game stand out of the crowd. And its not really a secret either, as most critics who held it in a regard this high, pointed directly at these things as reason for hte high evaluation. But it flies above the head of a lot of people, who fail to see the differentiation and just go ""koroks are a shitty collectible mate"".",4,sg5z8f,0,1643709400.0

Hollow Knight in terms of movement it's dashing and double jump and then being able to ""pogo"" off of enemies is really the main way to move in that game.

"I've thought about this a lot over the years as I've replayed each Souls game from time to time and felt like I should be finding fault with DS2 and I'm very comfortable these days in saying DS2 is absolutely my favourite in the series. 

Yes there are shortcomings (like the AGI stat tied to I-frames and Estus speed) but the criticisms are wildly overblown. Too many bad bosses? Sure some are bad and very easy but heaps are good. 

The DLC is best in the series with some amazing bosses, add that in and DS2 has many of the best bosses in the series. 

DS1 had the interconnected world but I love the layout of DS2, going on this big long adventure out in one direction then coming back the safe hub world and going off on a big long adventure in another direction. Much more functional fast travel helps too. 

And it has some really cool stuff that the rest of the series doesn't, like bonfire ascetics and powerstancing. Plus the best PvP, for anyone that cares about that.

I certainly don't buy into DS3 being the best. It's a wonderful game and I love it but still the weakest in the series IMO. It's smoother and looks better and has some QoL upgrades but is the least creative, the most linear, has the most annoying areas/enemies.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643678882.0

"It's a lot of little and not so little differences but if I had to condense it into a single statement I'd say this: Monster Hunter Rise is World but faster, more mobile but a fair bit leaner and more streamlined compared to world.

The first obvious thing is this: World is content complete thanks to Iceborne and Rise's equivelent expansion is coming this summer. There's simply more to do right now in World than Rise, and even discounting Icebourne I'd say that is still somewhat true.

Rise has better combat thanks to the Grappling-hook like Wirebugs and Wirebug skills and more fleshed out weapon kits, but the Wirebugs give you a LOT of mobility that makes the combat less punishing. In World if you get hit and stuck in a corner you're likely to get combo'd. In Rise you can tech out of it and get to safety so long as you have at least one wirebug.

World's Slinger by comparison is far more mundane. It has utility but it's far more about using specialized items like Flashbombs or Pods to interact with environmental traps to help in hunts. Icebourne gave it more utility for some weapons but I'm not that familiar with it.

In terms of the environment's you explore World's are bigger, more diverse in and of themselves and have more ways for you to interact with it. You can use things like hanging vines or a waterfall or certain ground environments to help trap the monster. They feel like fantastical, but still *realistic* environments that naturally formed over countless years.

Rise's environments are, in a simple word more video gamey. You fight the monsters in flat arena's segregated by mountains and caves. It's designed to accomidate the mobility you get with the wirebugs and Palamuttes to help you get to the hunt faster.

Finally there's the narrative. Monster Hunter isn't really about story, but World's feels more involved in comparison to Rise. To a point many people got annoyed by it because it made going through the campaign in Multiplayer obnoxious.

If you're liking world, stick with it. Rise has more Quality of Life but they're different enough games that I'd say they're both worthwhile experiences.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643579458.0

It rally isn't though. I'm not surprised that OP thinks its a great game as they say, its their only really played this one. 

But these games aren't made for the occasional player. They directly cater to a specific audience, which keeps the games alive and makes them profitable. 

An audience EA has catered to for two generations now. And almost *all* of that audiences expectations and standards were defied not met, on top of constant delays for a live service game.

It might not affect you, but for the core audience, the game is a complete mess.",0,sg5z8f,0,1643792105.0
"I actually love ME1. Some of the environments like Feros are so bleak and alien. The world building is the best in the series, and nothing feels rushed. There is no real existential threat (that you are aware of) in ME1, you’re just going after this bad guy who is up to bad things. ME2 and especially ME3 put these galaxy altering things on the table that make it a lot harder to work around the urgency in the narrative. The combat is definitely better in 2 and 3, though.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643741067.0
"Yeah, that's why I mentioned MOON. Something like that belongs in a less conventional RPG. No other quest in this game is that subversive and it's pretty lame that these alleged badasses are jebaited by a rando with a flash grenade",1,sg5z8f,0,1643603022.0
"Yeah and it almost feels a bit more ... otherwordly? Like they caught a lot of shit for having an elevator go up in Earthen Peak to then be surrounded by lava. There was a lot of logical inconsistency, and they seemed to just want to make every area feel very distinct. But it kind of makes the game feel a bit like a fever dream, a muddled unreal existence which a lot of the undead seem to live in.

I doubt this was intentional and more a side effect of missing Miyazaki, but it is a unique feel.",5,sg5z8f,0,1643605795.0

"Not to mention redesigning your UI/HUD and then getting your look changed haha - I've done the same thing multiple times with WoW.

And once you're done, check out Nioh as well.",3,sg5z8f,0,1643884520.0
"Only reason I haven't played it is no ps5 yet. Top of my list otherwise. You might also like Nioh, I am playing through for the first time right now and it's very challenging, souls-like. Combat is a bit different in that you can string together some pretty slick combos and unlock moves. Definitely worth working into your souls flow imo",2,sg5z8f,0,1643926185.0
Yeah that's totally fair. I would still take visually coherent factions over that bit of visual clarity,2,sg5z8f,0,1643666917.0

"My one slight issue is just I remember trying to extrapolate this point of ""whether it's smarter to be the type of warrior that always fights people head on and never resort to guerilla tactics"" to the present day. Because clearly that debate is 95% in the side of guerilla tactics today... and that's just because military strategy has advanced to the point where everyone knows stuff like that.

But then I had to remind myself... there is a good chance that at the time when these stories are supposed to be set that this was a legit debate. Because I remember hearing stories something to the effect of in the middle ages in Europe some people were reluctant to use an advanced bow that took less strength to draw because they felt it wasn't ""fair"".",2,sg5z8f,0,1643645161.0
"Yeah the fists can be tricky, I've found that if you upgrade the aspect of Demeter once or twice that can be quite effective, especially if you mod your special with a Zeus or Artemis boon or get the hammer upgrade that makes your dash-upper explosive. Lately I've been wanting to beef up the aspect of Zagreus, pair it with the Lambent Plume and Reckless Reflex to go for a high Dodge% build, seems like it could be fun.",2,sg5z8f,0,1643922632.0
"I'm a relative scrub compared to a lot of people, but I remember scouring youtube (I wish I saved the guide I found from a year ago). Here is a recent link ([https://gamerant.com/hades-best-boons-every-weapon/](https://gamerant.com/hades-best-boons-every-weapon/)) that I found with all the weapons and they kind of are doing the same thing I'm talking about. But basically the build for Twin Fists is:

Aspect of Zagreus: The specific aspect isn't crazy important, you probably could get away with swapping out a few of the others.

Boons: The important one is getting Divine Strike. Because there are a lot of attacks/enemies that are annoying that become trivial with Divine Strike. 

The link I posted goes into more detail about some of the other ideas for different fist builds. But for the most part as long as you have the ability to do two curses you shouldn't be too bad. 

The other key thing that I remember them talking about in the youtube video that I couldn't find link for: there is a trick to using the fist weapon in general. Apparently if you just keep spamming attack. I think it does like 3 attacks and after the 3rd it does some animation that kind of forces you to be vulnerable to getting hit. But if you mix in dashing in between every 2-3 attacks. You won't have that happen.",1,sg5z8f,0,1643928443.0
"Definitely not sleeping on bloodborne, have heard that’s the best of the lot.

just this morning we reached 2800 curator followers as a february milestone and I'm still doing [brainrack, the weekly newsletter](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/puzzlelovers/announcements/detail/5049100027297195348). though valve fucked up the new and upcoming releases sections with their latest fancy but useless lab updates. they removed sorting, making it impossible to see what's immediately coming or was released, other than uncharted (a true puzzle game) and other hyped to death stuff sometime in 2022. bundling new and trending together was always a bad idea, it's been like this for years, even though trending belongs to top sellers. both are based on sales/interest, while new is just stuff that's coming out around now, so something from november shouldn't be showing up there just because it's on sale.

and while store functionality took a major hit during the lunar sale, they also had much better discounts than in the winter sale, don't recall it happening last year. I picked up the usual round of solitaires and match-3s, but also some other stuff I didn't expect to get discounted this much.",3,skam4y,0,1643973304.0

"We had super indie horror Tormented Souls earlier in the year, and I just found another in the PS1 vibe.

I always felt there was a big difference in production effort between *actual* old fashioned games, and the indies that imitate them. But I feel like it’s not often a PS1-looking game goes so far as having sets of FMV cutscenes and good looking prerendered backgrounds. It’s also got a demo on Steam (where it costs $2 more)",1,skam4y,0,1643980163.0
Are any of the off-brand third party joycon controllers better at stopping drift?

"I honestly thought it was somewhat disappointing for how high praise it got.

Maybe it's a great game to play with someone that doesn't really play games but the puzzles really felt too easy and repititive, once you got whatever the gimmick was you often had to repeat it 10x without any increase in difficult.

We decided to play Portal 2 after finishing that and it does a much better job at taking a gimmick and making it progressively harder.

Also in terms of online co-op it's much nicer to not be forced into split screen but simply have an optional PiP mode, I know It Takes Two was designed with split screen in mind from the ground up but that lack of horizontal FOV got really annoying at times.",1,skdlq7,0,1643986885.0

"Very nice game from a technical standpoint, and the game design is very creative, yet also repetitive as you say, but the main issue is the awful story. I thought this would be a family friendly game with at least some level of insight and reflection on relationship, but... it's definitely not that. The general idea of tears and the scene with the elephant are honestly fucked up beyond belief. I'm not sure what people thought while creating this scene. It's just awful, and it was never touched on again. It just happened, as if doing that isn't something one should land in jail for the rest of their lives.

The game world and design: It's just a mechanic repetition of things we think of as beautiful and romantic, but they're copied from other movies and games. It's basically just the player being reminded by the game of nice things from the past, but it doesn't add anything on its own. Which is okay, but nothing to write home about.

Interesting game, but that this game wins so many awards is sadly a sign for the stagnation in the gaming industry.",1,skdlq7,0,1643987657.0

Rockstar has purposely dragged ass on releasing new games since GTAV came out and it's really frustrating, and if they're still years off from GTAVI, it's even more frustrating considering it's been 4 years since RDR2 came out. Like, what have they been doing for the past 4 years?

"I actually just refunded the game on Steam **but** I am looking forward to and I am optimistic for the game's future if DL1 is anything to go by. 

My issues are largely with very poor PC performance, at 1440p with a 2080ti with all of the RT turned off, I am only managing to get 70fps in empty areas, tends to swing down a bit when action picks up. The game really doesn't look that much better than DL1 either (there are definitely some improvements but its not the big gap I would expect for such a long time between games). Could be a system issue and not necessarily the game so I'm not too beat up about that yet. However, the crushing blow for me is:

* Combat feels way off in this one relative to Dying Light 1. Ragdolling seems to only proc when enemies die or under very specific scenarios

* Limb removal is pretty random and not tied to where you've hit the enemy most of the time (I hit a zombie in the head with a machete and its legs came off for example). 

* Swings dont bounce off the enemy's body if your weapon is too weak - baseball bat swings all the way through the body without interruption for example. 

* Kicking enemies off the top of buildings is completely fucked, the enemy kind of floats off the edge and then drops straight down rather than flying wildly off the side like in DL1. 

* Physics in general seem to be toned down a lot, the enemies seem to have more kinematic responses to the environment than the DL1 dynamic ragdolling that happened. 

* Running on PC kind of sucks, its either the build up sprint or nothing, there isnt a way to walk if you arent using a controller. 

* Ran into a ton of small glitches , nothing game breaking but largely just annoyances like the scan ability randomly not working

* Some key bindings are broken like mouse scroll, not sure whats going on there.

"I really basically just got through the tutorial section so I can't say for certain, I basically have one move unlocked other than ""bash with weapon"".

The things I have noticed:

- Weapons degrade much slower, so that shouldn't be something the player is burdened with.

- The movement is very different. No sprint button and you can jump a lot further. I believe their are lore reasons for this as well as control reasons. I can say that their is much more mid-air control which is a positive for the game. It definitely feels ""floaty"" compared to the first game but I imagine once I get used to it it won't.

- I'm noticing I can take on many zombies at once without much difficulty, however I'm on normal and might switch it up to hard mode if it remains too easy.

- I only have one move unlocked within it, but there's an enitre ""Parkour combat"" system in this game that looks like it's going to make fighting a lot more fun, especially fighting humans.",1,ske75q,0,1643986350.0
"Just different, honestly. Parkour is somewhat stat gated now, you are always sprinting, once a weapon breaks it is just broken (However modding a weapon also repairs it, so there's an interesting incentive to work with mundane weapons until they need repair).

I’m also right out of the prologue and I’d say in a good way. Inertia is more of a thing and it takes time to build up speed (in the early game) so you kinda have to plan your route a bit more. It just feels nicer to actually pull off parkour and maintain speed.,1,ske75q,0,1643986872.0
"Not really to be honest, but I can see how it could come off that way. 

The world is kindof a parkour arena, but thats specifically because the world has been lived in for 15 years post-infection and parkour is the best way to avoid zombies and move around a city if you're trying to avoid street level (which you are and everyone else is).

- The game kind of looks like arse, I hope a sequel has a much longer dev cycle and they take a lot more time to get the game to look good, Pokemon deserves is.

- Give us some voice acting, come on GameFreak, it's 2022

- Animations, especially for Human characters are lacklustre

- Pokemon in the environment. Right now Pokemon basically just move backs and forwards in a small circle. It looks stiff. Let the Pokemon interact with each other, let them interact with the environment, why don't Aipom interact with the trees for example. It's the first step to creating a believable, immersive world. I know Pokemon isn't exactly an immersive game but I don't see why these spin offs can't be to a certain degree.

- Story. The story are characters are kinda pants. Now I know I've not seen the ending but I doubt it'll change much.

-
(I played all games since red & blue)! 

* full 3D experience
* free control of your character,
* pokemon in the open world,
* shinies in the open world, 
* sneak and catch mechanics to enhance the experience,
* catching possible in both open world and battle, 
* new content, 
* little hand-holding,
* ...

A few negatives though... 

* the controls are unintuitive and change depending on situation (not being more specific, as I don't want to spoil )
* the score in the town is... questionable at best. It gets incredibly repetitive, to the point where I mute the game when I'm in town. 
* Areas are not connected, you have to travel between them and ""hand in your progress"" when you want to go somewhere else. 
* No breeding, though that makes sense considering the story.
* the camera Ai could have been better. When running the camera sometimes blocks the view.  And the button layout makes it annoying to change the camera while running.
* unable to change view distance (distance the camera is away from your character) For instance; in densely forested areas the camera gets lost in the sea of trees/branches.
* The colours could have been better, it's too over saturated, and too much contrast. 


Still rating it 9.5/10!
I love it!

---

There are of course some other changes as well:

* no IV's anymore, all pokemon are equal in stat
* EV's no get applied through a set of items, instead of through battle experience with XYZ pokemon. ( I am uncertain if there is a cap of EV's per pokemon, or if all stats can be maxed out at the same time )
* no need to hunt for TM's or HM's
* barely any trainer battles. So if you like that playstyle, you won't find much in this game.

"It's more grindy, but grind isn't difficulty. It's tedium. 

Pokemon has always been about endurance. When you go out into the routes, it's about getting from one end of the route to the next. if you're out grinding up levels for a pokemon to be ready for a gym, or because you want to evolve it or you're shiny hunting, or whatever else you might be doing, it's all about endurance. Taking out wild pokemon and trainers as fast as you can without taking damage otherwise you need to go back to the poke center or burn healing potions. 

What arceus has done has allowed wild pokemon a better chance to do damage to you. While that seems like it might be 'hard', it's not really. You aren't in danger of dying to most wild pokemon, but what you are in danger of is burning through healing potions and revives as a level 20 pokemon still does significant damage to a level 50 one. Even a low level pokemon like that can do massive damage to a high level pokemon if they have a super effective move. 

While it might 'balance' an individual fight, I think what the devs forgot is that wild pokemon are infinite. So times where a wild pokemon might do an agile rest and follow up with a strong attack of some kind is balance for you (it uses more PP so you have to sort of plan those out) it's meaningless to a wild pokemon because they'll never be in a fight long enough for those PP to matter. 

Yes, craft ingredients are very common, but there are areas where there aren't a ton of medicinal leeks, so that means loading up in another area first, which is just grind. 

The heavily reduced move pool is very annoying if you don't research it first. I was investing time in a machoke only to find out that he gets only a single fighting move of any value and only at like level 43. So I dumped him for toxicroak who can at least get drain punch. 

There are lots of good and interesting things in Arceus, but I never feel in danger. The only time I ran out of pokemon was when an alpha refused to get in a ball.

two wrong statements. Their target audience are adults. And kids care about graphics. You might be shocked, but I too was a kid at some point and one of the main selling points of Mario 64, Ocarina of Time and Banjo Kazooie were the insane graphics. 

The thing is, Nintendo games are for everyone. Just because Kids are able to play games like Pokemon and Mario, doesnt mean that adults dont.

Average age 22.3 years. 38% were university/collage studends, 32% were workers. 29% still went to school. 80% of people who played pokemon were legally adults (age above 18).

So I can't really argue against anything, just looking at the first Screenshots of the game that come up you can clearly see how incredibly out of place the smooth, cartoony characters and Pokemon feel, compared to the rough, shiny (another weird quirk of this game the rocks look shiny for some reason) and generally more realistic looking textures of the environment.

>Maybe there's something at some kind of technical level that I'm just not seeing,

I mean yes the game does have problems that are more technical than the graphics. Something like the dogshit anti-aliasing or the horrendous pop-in, but that's not really what we're talking about here.

>you're just way too invested in hating on something that doesn't really matter all that much?

I feel like you're the one to invested in this conversation, after all you're calling people insane, going through numerous areas in the game to prove your point. I  just think it's ridiculous that the people who made the **largest** media Franchise on this planet can't develop their games to look at least decent.",3,sk1bnn,0,1643974995.0

This is what happened to the RE3 in RE3make. They literally threw away most things that made RE3 unique and memorable in the first place\*, which resulted in much less unique and memorable game. It is possible that the same will happen to the RE4 if they will choose to ignore its strengths

Im sure they love RE4 more, but if RE3make is any indicator, prepare for more expensive RE4 with less in it :P

Though the best thing I discovered during this micro research were threads made after release of RE2, where people were disappointed by it compared to RE1 and some even were already bitching about how RE is now ruined and how they should go back to re1 formula xD Few examples, because its fascinating:

>a) RE2 was always stuck with the same A and B endings, even though the zapping system extended the playability of the game. I would have loved to see what happened if you didn't get Sherry the vaccine, or if you escaped with Ada, Annette, the gun shop owner, or the black cop still alive. **The ending is one of the most important and satisfying parts of a game and I would have loved to see multiple endings in RE2. But it was not to be...**  
>  
>b) Although RE2 is a great game, **I enjoyed RE1 a lot more.** I thought RE1 was harder (I have never died in RE2), I also liked the characters in RE1 a lot more than RE2, and I enjoyed the Real Life Movie cut-scenes in RE1 rather than the Animated cut-scenes in RE2.  
>  
>c) RE1's storyline was better, IMO, and makes a good plot for a movie. **In RE2, Sherry and Chief Irons were utter nonsense.** They were there for gameplay only. **RE2 would make a poor movie**, unless they modified the plot, of course.  
>  
>d) I absolutely agree with your entire statement... although the graphics were pretty good in the second, the better story-line and harder enemies in **RE1 made for a much more enjoyable game!**  
>  
>e) **i agree that RE1 is better....and more difficult! i can finish RE2 within a week but i can't did it on RE1.** i think the weakest point of RE2 is that the clues are so easy to find out... the whole story is that u just need to run, kill the zombies, run and kill the zombies. also the RE2 comes after the RE1, u may find u r not so frightened when u meet the zombies... cos u've come across even the Tyrant in RE1!  
>  
>f) Yeah, I know the 2 is really prettier, the animation is wonderful, the cinematic scenes are great, etc... etc... I also know the RE1 intro sucks, the game is too easy, the scenarios are the same... BUT, I must confess I took more pleasure with RE1 than RE2. The ambient was great (little corridors, dirty wallpapers, wooden stairs...), and it was a really discovery from the classic haunted house scenario to the Sci-Fi experiment on viruses. I also prefer the strange music on RE1, (when you were discovering the labs, for instance).  
>  
>g) **In terms of scare factor, RE1 still freaks me out. RE2 loses that sadly.** I mean when I played RE1, we were REALLY careful all the way in fear of getting killed...It's kinda like a comparison between Alien and Aliens. (1st and second movies) The first, there was a definite lack of ammo. **RE2 was like overkill... I think that capcom should go back to the RE1 format.** RE2 was a different experience altogether. Maybe i'm the only one, but i didn't really feel that scared or excited while playing through it.It felt as if the whole thing was just kind of repetitive and hastily constructed.  
>  
>h) I concur with your thoughts on RE1 vs RE2. Even though I played RE2 first I was far more enamoured and engrossed in RE1. Better story, and somehow it just felt like a far better integrated game. More to ""get into"" ya know? The larger scale of RE2 didn't help it's either non-existant or identical to RE1's plot-line. Yea it was a continuation of RE1's story, but did it have to be so similar? They say that Re1.5 wasn't released because it was too similar to RE1. **Well, it must have been nearly identical, because RE2 is too close to RE1 (dig that indentical ending) for comfort. Personally I'm not looking forward to RE3 or Veronica. How about a Night of the Living Dead game instead?**  
>  
>i) **RE2 was the second biggest disappointment (after Survivor).** This game was hyped to hell and when I finally got it and finished Leon's first scenario within 4 hours of putting it in my Playstation, I was very disappointed.  
>  
>j) **RE2, to me, is a total mess.** A lot of RE fans claim this to be the best (or one of the best) or the series, but I think it is the absolute worst. To me, it felt like Capcom found the original RE becomming a smash hit, knew they wanted a sequel, but had no idea where to take the game. Too many things didn't make sense, many of the puzzles were either exact copies of the ones in RE or were just stupid, and something felt ""off"" about the entire second half of the game. I also remember that this game had the least interesting storyline to me.

You have here a gallery of all typical flaws of new RE games - too actiony, too short, too similar to the previous one, not enough similar to the previous one, not scary, terrible story etc. All in all: RE fans will always be like ""new game ruined the series, lets go back to the previous one"" and its happening since 1998 :D",1,sjx6ig,0,1643979313.0
"Its interesting reading forums from the time and seeing how much discourse has stayed relatively similar even now.

But I do think the reason why people feel RE3 was under RE2's shadow is just more that RE2 did sell a lot better than RE3.

[Capcom's](https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html) website had RE2 at 4.96M sales while RE3 is 3.5M. Not sure why RE3 had lower sales but that is a pretty substantial difference.",1,sjx6ig,0,1643987299.0

I mostly disagree with this weird notion that appeared after the release of RE3make that RE3 was also heavily criticized, that it was disliked by critics, disliked by players and regarded as an asset flip etc. Re3 had amazing critical reception - it was even a runner up to the adventure game of a year - and its a fact. It was well received by player base - and its another fact, etc.",1,sjx6ig,0,1643987652.0

"I think when it comes to pokemon, there are 2 crowds: the single player jrpg fans and the social players. I wrote in a chain the other day which I thought might be an [interesting read](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch/comments/sa8mw3/_/htv7vep). The gist of it is that the battle system is pokemon's greatest strength and the devs should play to that benefit, not against it.

I bring this up here because SWSH at a glance is two very different experiences. You have the extremely mediocre single player campaign that offers no challenge and really, disappoints in basically every aspect especially when you compare it to its contemporaries in DQ11, MH stories 2, SMT5 and so on.

On the other hand, you have the social game. SWSH is a culmination of decades of pokemon trading and battling. Training pokemon is easier than ever, ranked mode offers well balanced competitive battles (I'm pretty proud of taking wigglytuff to master ball tier). The raid battles were a really fun way of playing with others in a PvE environment and offered great rewards. Both the DLCs improved the social aspect of the game significantly and imo the frozen tundra campaign was better than the base game campaign.

So it really depends on what you want to get out of pokemon. I really enjoyed SWSH despite being a big jrpg fan, because to me pokemon is more like CoD where you have a multiplayer game with a mediocre campaign attached to it. But some people might value the campaign more. Ultimately, I'd like a great singleplayer experience with a great social endgame.",65,sk3bci,0,1643963223.0

They're actually addressing this in Arceus, to an extent. They seem to know the gameplay is their best asset and have let it rest on its own laurels, but now that Sword and Shield got a lot of disappointing dissent, they seemed to want to take a second look at it and keep it fresh too.

Changing Freeze to a Sp. Attack Burn, and Sleep to a Damage increasing paralysis. Poison, in opposition to the other periodic damages, has the property of not wearing off. Stat increases are now single rank, and timed. Accuracy/Evasion is now a timed buff. Pokemon stats early on heavily sway onto the side of HP so early stage fights give more equal chances across species (Instead of, like, a level 10 zangoose sweeping a bunch of level 12 starters)

They're doing these things to make the game more ""fair"" for the player. It's possible that it'll mess up multiplayer, and some thing shave been made kind of annoying (Rest is overpowered, so are attacks like Mudslap, and likely need limits imposed onto them) but, given how there's no PVP in the spinoff, it's possible that they're giving it space and test the waters.",1,sk3bci,0,1643987823.0

Why cut yourself off from a major market who are outspoken in how much they still want to play a pokemon game. If they commit to ""we only want to make a game where children can enjoy this so we must make it incredibly simple with no complexity anymore"" then they're idiots.

And I don't think people explicitly complain because pokemon is assumedly ""for kids"" - it's more a combination of ""hey, Game Freak keeps putting minimal effort into their pokemon products and refuse to iterate, and even when they do iterate, it's a barebones tech demo with the promise of something better using those new systems on the horizon.""

even the Pokémon themselves are a lot less creative or well-designed. Cyndaquil and Charizard are statistically identical. like they’re literally the exact same pokémon. half the new Gen 2 pokémon’s stats were genuinely terrible compared to Gen 1 pokémon. and i’ve mentioned it already, but the level curve is probably the worst i’ve ever seen in a JRPG. Johto’s more open-ended design just doesn’t work in a JRPG with no level-scaling or difficulty balancing. the addition of Kanto is cool when you’re a kid, until you realize how bare bones and completely devoid of content it is. it’s the utter definition of meaningless padding.

like i said, i still love Gen 2, it was a huge part of my childhood, but it was by far the laziest and least improved Gen, and it’s really not close. even in the context of the technological capabilities of the time, the jump from Gen 1 to Gen 2 is minuscule compared to every other jump in Gens. i couldn’t stand Sword and Shield but it is just complete revisionism to suggest it, or any other recent Gen, is lower effort than Gen 2 was lol

The always on xp share made the game easier than ever and punished players for using their team repeatedly by making the content easy to over level.

Plenty went wrong with swsh, the worst of the games so far. Not that I hate itd but calling it ""good"" is generous and I've played every generation. The only thing good about swsh is competitive battling has the lowest entry bar ever. Which IS very good but doesnt excuse the game being a glorified online battle more than a ln rpg.",1,sk3bci,0,1643984718.0
"Honestly I feel like reddit is too harsh on SwSh. I still have *a lot* of problems with it, like the dex being significantly cut (a lot of my favorite pokemon were cut), the absurd amount of cutscenes, the removal of the elite four, it's way too easy to overlevel, etc. But things like the Wild Area are awesome and there's *sooo* many really nice quality of life changes, like having two daycares, bottle caps, mints, etc. I've heard some people complain about this making the game ""too easy"" but honestly idc. Idk about you, but I never intend on trying to breed the perfect pokemon with max IVs and the right nature. And if I happen to find a shiny, I'd like to make sure its stats aren't shit so I can actually use it and show off my cool looking pokemon. I also feel like the DLC also fixed a lot of the issues I had with the game and just became a really fun game at that point. 

I see a lot of people also complain about graphics, but honestly imo the graphics in Sw/Sh are great. People always try to compare it to Breath of the Wild, but I don't think Nintendo has had a game with the same quality as Breath of the Wild except maybe Mario Odyssey. It seems unfair imo to compare it to the best of the best and just say, ""just do that for every pokemon game, it'll be easy,"" on top of the fact that every single pokemon needs to have the same quality of graphics and walking/battle animations. I also see people fixate on [this texture of this one tree](https://i0.wp.com/nintendosoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-ocarina-of-time-tree-banner-jun162019.jpg?resize=900%2C576&ssl=1), which is really weird because while this tree's texture isn't great, the rest of the game's textures are fine.

I’ve been with the franchise since it came out in South America when I was 6 so this is coming from a nostalgic bastard fan. I love these games. There’s no other monster catching game that gives me the same joy that Pokémon games give me. Not to say that others are bad, I’ve truly enjoyed the SMT and Digimon games I’ve played.

I’m not blind, I see the flaws. But these games have always been flawed. The most technical sound of the games came out in late 2000’s when GF were finally used to the DS hardware. But I’ve been playing the franchise for decades now. I know what I’m getting out of it. I think a lot of what people don’t seem to get is that they keep equating GF to AAA studios because Pokémon is the most successful franchise of all time. But the fact is that GF is built and run like it’s a AA studio, the most successful AA studio of all time. They want high quality games but GF isn’t built for that.

Newer games, however, have made a huge effort to add in a bunch of tutorial content that, at least in my experience, I was forced to play through.  Tutorials on how to catch Pokemon or how to use items - actions that many of us figured out at a very young age without a guiding hand.  Maybe sw/sh is better, but it really gets exhausting.

There is not another franchise that comes even *close* to that and that includes all the damn gens. Pokémon designs and character designs are still top notch and the gameplay system is still excellent.

What other monster capturing franchise comes even *close* to these qualities? Digimon has long given up and taken an entirely different approach, being way more of a ""core RPG"" type of game nowadays (and being much more niche in turn). Temtem, the promised Pokémon-like MMO underdelivered in its proposal and its monster don't hold a *candle* to Pokémon. You could argue Yokai Watch, which had creative designs *and* solid games.

Pokémon fangames like Uranium that try and make ""adult Pokémon"" have embarassing stories and bad designs to boot.

SMT is the closest I can think of ""monster capturing"" gameplay that is excellent in every aspect, but it's an entirely different gamer for *extremely* core JRPG fans.

There is a *whole lot* to criticize about Pokémon and the series has problems that can be *traced* to its own early success (the amount of creatures and how that impacts 3D production, it being 2D-focused for so long which means GF teams work much better on that format, etc). Discussing all of that is super valid, and there's absolutely no need to go to either extreme of SwSh being amazing or terrible games.

The bottom line is that the game was well received by the critics, sold amazingly well and left an staying impact on the gaming sphere.

They are focusing on Starfield while TESVI is on pre-production,1,skfbdw,0,1643988449.0
"They made it pretty clear that they were working on Starfield first, but I guess people thought they’d split their development efforts or something. Nope, it truly was them saying “we’re making Starfield and then after that, we’ll do Elder Scrolls 6.” I’m pretty sure they recent said they still haven’t actually started Elder Scrolls 6. It’ll happen some day, that’s all they have to say. Best just forget about it for a few more years…",1,skfbdw,0,1643988584.0

"Bethesda is in dire need of an expansion, imo. There's really no reason for successful IPs like Fallout and Elder Scrolls not to have at least 1 main entry release per console generation, so around 5-6 years. Hopefully, Microsoft will push them in that direction.",1,skfbdw,0,1643988765.0
"I am happy to get a new IP from Bethesda while I wait for the next Elder Scrolls.  Besides, I still have quests in Skyrim and even Oblivion that I have yet to finish",1,skfbdw,0,1643988972.0
